2018-12-18 00:45:37	ergo0	does this come in?
2018-12-17 23:51:31	@frinnst	its part of linux-pam
2018-12-17 23:51:37	@frinnst	crux 3.4 does not use pam
2018-12-17 23:51:46	@frinnst	3.5 might do (currently being tested)
2018-12-17 23:52:35	@frinnst	you can probably ignore that part of the how-to
2018-12-18 01:17:14	ergo0	frinnst: ahh thanks, i will look into that 
2018-12-18 01:17:37	ergo0	i remember that installing linux-pam could mess up my system if i dont know what im doing tho 
2018-12-18 01:17:39	ergo0	someone in here told me

2018-12-18 01:40:11	ergo0	i will look into that later 
2018-12-18 01:40:22	ergo0	im trying to look into steam now 
2018-12-18 00:40:25	@frinnst	if you *REALLY* need it: https://github.com/mhoush/crux-pam/
2018-12-18 01:40:38	ergo0	for some reason it crashes with this error message
2018-12-18 01:40:43	ergo0	Failed to open digital audio driver Couldn't open OAL device
2018-12-18 00:41:17	@frinnst	just make sure you have access to the crux install medium if you screw something up. that way you can boot it and reinstall the 3.4 packages of shadow, sudo etc
2018-12-18 00:42:44	@frinnst	"export STEAM_RUNTIME=0; steam worked for me on fedora 18"

2018-12-18 01:43:18	ergo0	yee that should work for me as well 
2018-12-18 01:43:25	ergo0	guess i will just have to install the dependencies 
2018-12-18 00:43:36	@frinnst	yeah steam seems like a dependency hell
2018-12-18 00:43:58	@frinnst	I just keep a windows disk. keeps me from polluting my crux install :-)
2018-12-18 01:45:57	ergo0	i just use wine and proton
2018-12-18 01:46:03	ergo0	keeps me from polluting my computer :) 
2018-12-18 01:55:39	ergo0	hmm apparently i need a libva32 package , which is not in the portdb 
2018-12-18 00:55:42	@jaeger	PAM itself isn't evil or anything but you CAN break your ability to log in or authenticate if you set it up wrong
2018-12-18 01:55:46	ergo0	never build a 32bit port myself 
2018-12-18 00:56:15	@jaeger	Nothing that's permanent as you can always rescue from the install media or a live cd

2018-12-18 16:15:23	pedja	hm. current docker version I have installed is 17.11.0-ce. damn, that's old
2018-12-18 16:17:02	pedja	can't upgrade,too, something about jfs missing some thing that overlayfs depends on. fun
2018-12-18 16:20:09	@jaeger	Is JFS still actively developed?
2018-12-18 16:20:43	pedja	not really :)
2018-12-18 16:21:14	@jaeger	Maybe time to switch
2018-12-18 16:24:35	pedja	I've been thinking about it for a while now, but can't afford the hw atm, so it'll have to wait for a bit longer
2018-12-18 16:28:01	@jaeger	not even a temporary external usb HDD?
2018-12-18 16:29:20	pedja	well, apart from /, all partitions are jfs
2018-12-18 16:29:35	pedja	2x1tb hdds
2018-12-18 16:30:41	pedja	if I get 2+Tb hdd, I am not sure it can even boot with my ancient BIOS without some dark magic
2018-12-18 16:31:55	pedja	grub2 can probably do it :)
2018-12-18 16:35:37	pedja	full upgrade would solve that nicely, but the same issue, lack of funds :)
2018-12-18 16:37:23	pedja	technology came a long way since 2008, when I bought this potatoputer
2018-12-18 16:38:54	joacim	i think it can boot if you use less than 2TB partititons
2018-12-18 16:40:23	pedja	you might be right, it's been a while since I researched that
2018-12-18 16:41:44	@jaeger	You could also get a smaller SSD for your main OS install and keep the HDDs for storage
2018-12-18 16:42:47	pedja	jaeger, that's a good idea, 250gb ssd's are not that expensive atm
2018-12-18 16:42:52	@jaeger	yeah
2018-12-18 16:43:09	@jaeger	And SSDs are the single best quality-of-life improvement on computers in a long time :)
2018-12-18 16:43:39	joacim	sometimes see someone insist ssds are nothing but a waste of time and offers zero improvements
2018-12-18 16:44:49	pedja	250gb 860evo is ~70? here
2018-12-18 16:46:01	pedja	that's more than enough for crux :)
2018-12-18 16:46:38	joacim	just dont make a 30GB partition for crux like I did =)
2018-12-18 16:46:39	@jaeger	joacim: in my opinion anyone who says that doesn't use a computer, or never used one with spinning rust
2018-12-18 16:47:06	joacim	yeah. the difference is like night and day
2018-12-18 16:47:12	@jaeger	or is trolling, I guess :P
2018-12-18 16:47:21	joacim	probably the latter =)
2018-12-18 16:47:51	pedja	or used ssd bought from shady vendor on aliexpress :)
2018-12-18 16:48:06	joacim	want to go all SSD in my threadripper too now. one of the cheaper slower SSDs for /home and virtual machines
2018-12-18 16:48:07	@jaeger	perhaps, heh
2018-12-18 16:48:08	joacim	660p maybe

2018-12-18 16:50:18	@jaeger	I upgraded to 4x 8TB somewhat recently
2018-12-18 16:50:34	pedja	nice
2018-12-18 16:50:36	@jaeger	was a mix of 2TB and 4TB drives before
2018-12-18 16:50:52	pedja	which brand are the new ones?
2018-12-18 16:51:03	joacim	would like a couple of 2u cases for my nas
2018-12-18 16:51:05	joacim	+ backups
2018-12-18 16:51:09	@jaeger	WD reds, specifically WD80EFZX
2018-12-18 16:51:47	joacim	need more space first =)
2018-12-18 16:52:30	pedja	jaeger, they are marketed as NAS disks, right? as in tailored for that use?
2018-12-18 16:52:54	@jaeger	they are, yeah
2018-12-18 16:53:22	@jaeger	For my workloads/use cases pretty much any reliable drive would do, but I've never had problems with reds so I keep buying them
2018-12-18 16:53:41	joacim	red are also somewhat quiet
2018-12-18 16:53:49	@jaeger	Yeah
2018-12-18 16:54:15	joacim	i have ironwolf drives. they're nice, but loud. can definitely hear them from across the room
2018-12-18 16:54:23	pedja	well, it's either wd or seagate, no more major players in that field, afaik
2018-12-18 16:54:30	joacim	loud by my definition of loud
2018-12-18 16:54:39	joacim	i think the 600 RPM fans in my computer is loud =)
2018-12-18 16:54:51	pedja	you have a freak elvish hearing
2018-12-18 16:55:36	joacim	related to northern sami, which is kinda related to finns
2018-12-18 16:55:39	joacim	is that elvish?
2018-12-18 16:56:19	pedja	all Scandinavians are elvish, afaik :)
2018-12-18 16:56:59	joacim	norwegians are more obsessed with trolls
2018-12-18 16:57:21	joacim	pretty much every tourist shop has a bunch of trolls for sale =)
2018-12-18 16:58:22	pedja	yeah, I've watched Trollhunter
2018-12-18 16:58:48	pedja	'Trolljegeren'?
2018-12-18 16:59:37	joacim	yeh =)
2018-12-18 17:00:19	pedja	luckily, American remake was canceled
2018-12-18 17:00:39	pedja	because it would suuuuck big time, imho
2018-12-18 17:01:07	joacim	not sure where they'd get their trolls from
2018-12-18 17:01:24	pedja	White House?
2018-12-18 17:01:29	joacim	samsquanch maybe
2018-12-18 17:01:41	joacim	yeah. or donald trump =)
2018-12-18 17:05:56	pedja	speaking of creatures with interesting hair, new Predator is fun
2018-12-18 17:06:47	pedja	stupid, predictable, but fun
2018-12-18 17:08:11	joacim	yeah was a nicemovie =)
2018-12-18 17:08:26	joacim	i got confused by the number of them tho
2018-12-18 17:10:29	pedja	it would be much less fun if it wasn't r-rated

2018-12-18 18:00:22	@jaeger	both sonarr and nzbget/sabnzbd would need access to the downloads and sonarr would need access to the destination for processed files

2018-12-18 19:01:30	ergo0	then i went to the folders for downloads and library respectively and did chown -R ronin:docker on them 
2018-12-18 19:01:44	ergo0	but it seems docker is running as a different user 
2018-12-18 18:01:47	@jaeger	the dave thing is a reference to hal9000
2018-12-18 18:02:07	@jaeger	2001
2018-12-18 19:02:18	ergo0	damn, never heard of that before 
2018-12-18 18:02:53	@jaeger	are you using the linuxserver.io upstream docker containers?
2018-12-18 19:02:59	ergo0	yess 
2018-12-18 18:03:21	@jaeger	ok, did you follow their instructions for creating your local containers including the env vars for user and group IDs?
2018-12-18 19:03:30	ergo0	yess i did 
2018-12-18 19:03:34	ergo0	i used 100 and 10 
2018-12-18 19:03:37	ergo0	also tried 100 and 100 
2018-12-18 19:03:42	ergo0	for UID and GUID respectively 
2018-12-18 18:04:01	@jaeger	ok, what is the full command line you used to create the container?
2018-12-18 19:04:12	ergo0	this is what happens when i try to select a folder in sonarr https://a.pste.pw/NFX.png
2018-12-18 19:04:39	ergo0	also the command i used to create the docker - https://bpaste.net/show/411d6ff8f1ba
2018-12-18 19:05:05	ergo0	im using a btrfs formatted hard drive mounted in fstab as so : UUID=079f64fa-cdfc-4f64-b097-f69d65c5e418 /media btrfs defaults,noatime,rw,exec        0 2
2018-12-18 18:05:09	@jaeger	ok, so does your 'ronin' user have full access to /media?
2018-12-18 19:05:25	ergo0	if I did the mounting right, yes 
2018-12-18 19:05:37	ergo0	i also tried chowning the folder and chmodding the drive 
2018-12-18 18:06:34	@jaeger	Well, there's nothing in that fstab line that specifies permissions, so I'd double check the permissions on disk
2018-12-18 18:06:41	@jaeger	Make sure ronin can create, delete, move, etc.
2018-12-18 19:07:14	ergo0	yee i can 
2018-12-18 18:07:18	@jaeger	also, your folder mounts in the docker create don't match up with their docs
2018-12-18 18:07:36	@jaeger	you need to end up with /tv, /downloads, and /config mounted in the container
2018-12-18 19:08:01	ergo0	hmmmmm i thought i could jsut adjust it 
2018-12-18 19:08:05	ergo0	but i willl try that then 
2018-12-18 18:08:08	@jaeger	your ~/appdata/sonarr:/config one looks ok but the /tv and /downloads are missing
2018-12-18 19:08:31	ergo0	the ronin user can cp , mv, and create files btw 
2018-12-18 19:09:04	ergo0	ayee lemme try that then 
2018-12-18 18:09:55	@jaeger	maybe you can change them in sonarr but those options don't seem immediately obvious to me and anyway, no real benefit to doing so, since you can just map in different folders via docker create
2018-12-18 19:10:19	ergo0	i can? 
2018-12-18 19:10:34	ergo0	i was wondering if i could add folders after a docker is created but couldnt find it 
2018-12-18 18:11:16	@jaeger	Generally no
2018-12-18 19:11:23	ergo0	jaeger: this should do it right? https://bpaste.net/show/684c191589a8
2018-12-18 18:11:42	@jaeger	that looks better
2018-12-18 19:12:20	ergo0	hmm now it doesnt see any folder 
2018-12-18 18:12:54	@jaeger	I think you need to add series to it and scan them for it to see files you already have
2018-12-18 19:13:03	ergo0	yee im trying that 
2018-12-18 19:13:09	ergo0	but i cant access the media drive now 
2018-12-18 19:13:13	ergo0	let me try chowning it or something 
2018-12-18 18:14:26	@jaeger	all of my folders (tv, downloads, config) are owned by my user
2018-12-18 18:15:05	joacim	john_cephalopoda: he gets smashed, and gets to smash
2018-12-18 19:15:08	ergo0	could you show me a ls -la of your folder? 
2018-12-18 18:15:10	joacim	sounds like a good time to me

2018-12-18 18:15:32	joacim	the cpma player?

2018-12-18 19:16:06	ergo0	sonarr cant find the path now hmmm 
2018-12-18 19:16:13	ergo0	i just did chown -R ronin: /media 
2018-12-18 18:16:42	joacim	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXNE0AZarYY
2018-12-18 18:16:50	joacim	some kind of fun video game
2018-12-18 18:17:22	@jaeger	not sure what to tell you, it works great for me. I have all folders just owned by me, didn't mess with group permissions
2018-12-18 18:17:28	@jaeger	Got to go run errands, AFK
2018-12-18 18:17:45	pedja	fun video game? like rocks and diamonds?
2018-12-18 18:18:56	joacim	shoot rockets and kill eachother with air control =)
2018-12-18 18:20:46	pedja	ah, quake mod. I should've guessed :)
2018-12-18 19:22:14	ergo0	i solved it 
2018-12-18 19:22:30	ergo0	apparently i had to change -v /media/anime:/tv to media/anime:/tv lol 
2018-12-18 20:04:50	ergo0	if you happen to come back, maybe you could point me to how to solve sonarr not being able to find sabnzbd 
2018-12-18 20:05:02	ergo0	the internet aint telling me much jaeger 
2018-12-18 20:20:03	ergo0	i solved it by using the hostname instead of localhost

2018-12-18 21:37:57	ergo0	pedja: thats what i thought but both openal and openal32 are installed 
2018-12-18 21:38:15	ergo0	i guess i could try rebuilding both 
2018-12-18 21:38:27	ergo0	this is the log with the runtime disabled btw https://paste.pound-python.org/show/8ARro7hLKFWDcarOJtr4/
2018-12-18 20:38:27	@frinnst	fuck i love btrfs
2018-12-18 21:38:42	ergo0	> having btrfs installed but using none of its functions 
2018-12-18 20:39:15	@frinnst	"my nvme has been running stable without dissapearing for +1 year now, lets switch to use that as the rootfs"
2018-12-18 20:39:48	@frinnst	btrfs send | btrfs receive - tweak fstab, efibootmgr magic and reboot
2018-12-18 21:40:30	ergo0	damn that does sound reallly nice 
2018-12-18 21:41:01	ergo0	all this trouble, reinstalling openal-32 fixed the issue 
2018-12-18 21:41:12	ergo0	actually spend like 3 hours on this 
2018-12-18 20:41:18	pedja	when in doubt, rebuild :)
2018-12-18 20:42:57	pedja	'openal-info' for sanity check, iirc
2018-12-18 20:44:34	pedja	frinnst, what's next? patching grub so you can use boot from snapshots :) ?
2018-12-18 21:44:49	ergo0	oh well, i learned something about creating 32bit ports i guess 
2018-12-18 20:44:49	pedja	s/use//
2018-12-18 20:45:06	@frinnst	btrbk is really awesome but yeah, haven't really streamlined restores at all :)
2018-12-18 21:45:18	ergo0	audio is still scuffed, but i know there is a fix for that 
2018-12-18 21:45:24	ergo0	but nouw that all of that is done, time ot go the gym 
2018-12-18 20:45:52	pedja	ergo0, about that. you might want to modify libva-32 not to overwrite stuff shipped with libva port
2018-12-18 21:46:18	ergo0	i think that already happened, but i will look into that when i get back 
2018-12-18 20:46:26	pedja	:)
2018-12-18 20:47:33	pedja	frinnst, I would suggest snapper, but I know you don't like apps that have .io domain
2018-12-18 20:48:14	@frinnst	correct

2018-12-18 21:37:58	joacim	one of those shows where everyone is angry and mean to eachother?
2018-12-18 21:38:58	pedja	no, one of those shows where the 'hero' is the least interesting of all :)
2018-12-18 21:39:56	pedja	hero and half of the main cast I couldn't care less for

2018-12-19 17:52:10	joacim	played terraria, conan exiles, went outside and got some gifts + a few packages from the post office
2018-12-19 17:52:24	joacim	took pictures of my package while unwrapping, since the box was very moist
2018-12-19 17:52:49	joacim	the item itself was good and dry tho

2018-12-19 17:54:06	joacim	pedja: not much snow left around here. it is too warm right now
2018-12-19 17:54:38	joacim	some on the side of the road, and on lawns. mostly just ice :(
2018-12-19 17:55:04	pedja	same here. makes for a challenging walk around the city :)
2018-12-19 17:56:51	pedja	I think my Ensoniq es1370 is still around here somewhere
2018-12-19 17:57:06	joacim	i want to live somewhere with a lot of snow
2018-12-19 17:57:17	joacim	but the cities where my services are relevant tend to be near the coast
2018-12-19 17:57:22	joacim	so the weather is mild
2018-12-19 17:57:38	pedja	apply for Antartic station :)
2018-12-19 17:57:47	joacim	no idea there are any inland or northern cities in sweden that are consistently cold
2018-12-19 17:58:29	joacim	Oulu in Finland maybe
2018-12-19 17:59:55	pedja	isn't it cold in Hell, NO?
2018-12-19 18:00:20	joacim	thats just north of here
2018-12-19 18:00:26	joacim	more or less the same weather =)
2018-12-19 18:01:19	Anselmo	arent there like, data centers in deliberately very cold places
2018-12-19 18:01:28	Anselmo	or, I dont know quite what your services are,
2018-12-19 18:01:35	pedja	MS has one underwater
2018-12-19 18:01:48	Anselmo	its without workers though
2018-12-19 18:02:32	joacim	i think im more fit for administration work
2018-12-19 18:03:00	joacim	managing systems and services in general
2018-12-19 18:03:54	pedja	joacim, so 20C in August? that's awesome :)
2018-12-19 18:04:17	joacim	yeah. july and august can be pretty damn hot
2018-12-19 18:04:25	pedja	half of the usual temps here at that time of the year
2018-12-19 18:04:35	joacim	evenings can be a bit chilly tho, in august
2018-12-19 18:09:32	pedja	my father worked in Russia for a couple of years a while back, and sometimes it was -30C
2018-12-19 18:09:48	joacim	i sometimes get -20
2018-12-19 18:09:59	joacim	but i think -10 is more common during the colder months
2018-12-19 18:10:17	joacim	november and december tend to be mild, so -5 to 5C is more common
2018-12-19 18:10:24	pedja	so now when it's -5, -10C here, he says 'it's a bit chilly' :)
2018-12-19 18:10:36	joacim	it is =)
2018-12-19 18:10:43	joacim	worst weather is how it is now
2018-12-19 18:10:53	joacim	since the air is a bit more moist
2018-12-19 18:10:57	joacim	and it all feels so much colder
2018-12-19 18:11:08	joacim	-10C is so much nicer, since everything is dry
2018-12-19 18:11:17	pedja	you live near the coastline?
2018-12-19 18:14:12	pedja	I live near the big river, so when the wind starts in the autumn or winter, it's fscking freezing
2018-12-19 18:15:18	pedja	cleans the air nicely, thou

2018-12-19 18:16:08	joacim	same one hell is in =)
2018-12-19 18:16:31	joacim	doesnt take long to reach the proper coast tho
2018-12-19 18:18:46	pedja	'I went to Hell and back' doesn't sound so sinister :)
2018-12-19 18:19:35	joacim	been there a few times. mostly just passing through tho
2018-12-19 18:19:42	joacim	friend used to live there
2018-12-19 18:37:06	ryuo	Am I weird in that I can diagnose my own network issues? It seems like developers commonly have issues with basic system administration tasks...
2018-12-19 18:37:42	Anselmo	oh ?
2018-12-19 18:38:14	ryuo	Yea... someone that knows enough to setup a development VM on a laptop somehow couldn't figure out why their ethernet wasn't working.
2018-12-19 18:38:30	Anselmo	o_o
2018-12-19 18:38:37	ryuo	it only took a few commands to figure out the issue. their ethernet didn't have a default gateway defined.
2018-12-19 18:39:08	ryuo	i just handled that on #ubuntu
2018-12-19 18:39:51	ryuo	i'm starting to wonder if people with IT and development experience are a rare breed among developers in general.
2018-12-19 18:40:57	Anselmo	that seems weird. but I dont really know much about the education of like, cs students. . .
2018-12-19 18:41:18	Anselmo	but seems like something you'd learn just, using linux
2018-12-19 18:41:19	Anselmo	x-x
2018-12-19 18:44:35	ryuo	Anselmo: not necessarily. my only course that covered this was under IT.
2018-12-19 18:44:55	ryuo	most courses don't involve networking per say as part of the software work.
2018-12-19 18:46:35	joacim	ryuo: i had it engineering students show up at work asking me to install the OS for them
2018-12-19 18:47:00	joacim	takes 15 minutes to do, and doesn't take much effort
2018-12-19 18:47:00	Anselmo	bleah, good thing I dropped out of school early :P
2018-12-19 18:47:25	joacim	i think most that work with computers should have at least some basic understanding of booting and installing an os, + partitioning a drive
2018-12-19 18:47:49	Anselmo	what is like, the best way to teach that though ?
2018-12-19 18:48:25	joacim	when i went to school myself, a lot of people had issues with their vm networking. they didn't seem to have much control over which switch in hyper-v they used
2018-12-19 18:48:34	joacim	or the network settings in general
2018-12-19 18:48:55	Anselmo	or, I mean I guess just like, throw them infront of computers with blank disks and some basic linux install media and have at it. .
2018-12-19 18:49:01	Anselmo	ah, bleah
2018-12-19 18:49:22	Anselmo	like, simply had no access to that joacim ?
2018-12-19 18:49:34	joacim	maybe it is just interest. i dont know

2018-12-20 16:56:20	ergo0	cool 
2018-12-20 16:57:59	ergo0	so im trying to make a port for thunar, i made multiple dep ports along the way but i cant seem to get the exo port to work, which is this https://github.com/xfce-mirror/exo/tree/master/docs. i get a error saying that it cant find libxfce4util as in this log, but its installed as you can see here https://paste.pound-python.org/show/0nYCW2bBd6k1dJegDIF0/ , included the link for the footprint. this is the pkgfile

2018-12-20 16:12:19	@jaeger	I would suspect that PKG_CONFIG_PATH env var might be the problem
2018-12-20 16:12:27	@jaeger	But I'm not too familiar with xfce packages
2018-12-20 16:13:05	@jaeger	Maybe take a look at https://crux.nu/gitweb/?p=ports/xfce.git;a=tree for some help? It's out of date but might still be useful
2018-12-20 16:14:04	@jaeger	Anyway, PKG_CONFIG_PATH works similarly to PATH in that it expects a colon-separated list of directories, not files
2018-12-20 17:42:11	ergo0	jaeger: i tried the dir as well btw , i tried it without the env variable first but that didnt work for some reason 
2018-12-20 17:42:19	ergo0	that gave me the same error 
2018-12-20 17:42:58	ergo0	i also wasnt aware of that repo lol. i guess i can adopt the packages instead of building them myself 
2018-12-20 17:43:01	ergo0	and keep them up to date 
2018-12-20 17:48:11	ergo0	those packages are p old arent they 
2018-12-20 17:20:13	pedja	there is some random dude's xfce repo, iirc. but he is not to be trusted
2018-12-20 18:30:15	ergo0	how soo? 
2018-12-20 18:34:24	ergo0	why is this xfce thing so difficult 
2018-12-20 18:34:27	ergo0	other ports are easy 
2018-12-20 18:34:43	ergo0	do any of you use gui file managers that dont have a bezillion deps?

2018-12-20 19:39:47	john_cephalopoda	i3wm.
2018-12-20 19:40:09	john_cephalopoda	Oh, read "window manager" instead of "file manager".
2018-12-20 19:40:30	john_cephalopoda	I am using pcmanfm.
2018-12-20 19:41:36	john_cephalopoda	ergo0: ^

2018-12-20 20:48:16	ergo0	john_cephalopoda: ayee, lemme try that out , never used it before 
2018-12-20 20:49:00	ergo0	can you rice that? 
2018-12-20 19:49:35	john_cephalopoda	Rice in which way?
2018-12-20 20:49:42	ergo0	make it look prettier lol 
2018-12-20 19:50:57	john_cephalopoda	How do you define "pretty"?
2018-12-20 19:51:06	john_cephalopoda	It just looks like any file manager.
2018-12-20 20:52:11	ergo0	i wouldnt go for the pink, but like this is an example of what you can do with thunar https://preview.redd.it/tu6z3hmtoq121.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c1c6b67e6288e905fbaf8eadb868e21814b0ed49
2018-12-20 20:52:17	ergo0	i guess its peach instead of pink 
2018-12-20 20:53:46	ergo0	or like this https://external-preview.redd.it/wqUgyIK2e7X0IqnM_htkC0YGmUykkKMP0T_C9otn4p8.jpg?auto=webp&s=fd84757510b401dd5c44fbfe1100e11ae2527150
2018-12-20 19:54:52	john_cephalopoda	That's all super-customized stuff.
2018-12-20 19:55:05	john_cephalopoda	Maybe you can theme it somehow.
2018-12-20 20:55:39	ergo0	i guess i will just trey and get this damn thunar port to work ree 
2018-12-20 20:55:44	ergo0	its a really nice file manager regardless 
2018-12-20 19:58:28	john_cephalopoda	ergo0: It uses gtk, so you can theme it with lxappearance and GTK themes of your choice.
2018-12-20 21:01:06	ergo0	ohh thats neat 
2018-12-20 21:01:13	ergo0	i might look into it further, thanks for the tip 
2018-12-20 20:03:41	@jaeger	I mostly use bash for file management :D But when I need a GUI I generally use caja because I already have MATE installed

2018-12-20 21:12:00	ergo0	you have a secret port perhaps ?

2018-12-20 21:12:35	ergo0	you mean the one jaeger linked me earlier?

2018-12-20 20:46:27	pedja	as in 'they build, afaik' :)
2018-12-20 20:47:21	pedja	never bothered to submit it to repodb

2018-12-20 23:03:38	pedja	it's interesting that, over time, ZoL became the most worked on zfs port
2018-12-20 23:06:26	pedja	and yet, apart from Ubuntu, zfs is not that well integrated in any major distribution
