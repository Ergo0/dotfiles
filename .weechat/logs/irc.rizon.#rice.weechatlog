2018-11-06 10:29:44	Ergo	Like in games like HS and MTGA you are always so reliant on your draws
2018-11-06 10:29:46	Ergo	gwent has none of that 
2018-11-06 10:30:00	+Rue	enju: so i just bought enough cards for a black  pauper deck, and the rest i acquired with my smooth talks lol
2018-11-06 10:30:03	+Rue	aka begging
2018-11-06 10:30:07	+Khorne	enju, 60 card decks still?
2018-11-06 10:30:18	@enju	yes, and 15 sidedeck
2018-11-06 10:30:26	Ergo	i think Homecoming is in a really good place now as well, and after a expansion or two the game is gonna be top notch
2018-11-06 10:30:33	@enju	40 for limited, 100 for EDH
2018-11-06 10:30:35	+Khorne	(15/60)^9 ~ 0.3
2018-11-06 10:30:35	Ergo	the only thing its missing now is some depth in terms of mechanics 
2018-11-06 10:30:43	+Khorne	eh 0.03
2018-11-06 10:30:49	@enju	you are right
2018-11-06 10:31:04	Ergo	i had 21 lands 
2018-11-06 10:31:14	@enju	I wish they would have redone MTGO instead of making MTGA, but eh
2018-11-06 10:31:29	+Rue	duels of champions was REAL fun :>
2018-11-06 10:32:00	+Khorne	enju, fek no i wasnt
2018-11-06 10:32:03	+Khorne	cant use calc
2018-11-06 10:32:13	+Khorne	0.00000381469
2018-11-06 10:32:23	Ergo	sssssssssszzs
2018-11-06 10:32:23	@enju	yeah
2018-11-06 10:32:36	+Khorne	for 15 lands
2018-11-06 10:32:40	+Rue	a lot of good games don't live long enough to make it worth the time and effort you're willing to put in. kids all migrate to games for the masses
2018-11-06 10:32:43	+Khorne	for 21 its 0.00007881563
2018-11-06 10:32:54	@enju	Rue thats why you play MTG instead
2018-11-06 10:32:56	+Khorne	so you got really really unlucky in your one game
2018-11-06 10:32:59	Ergo	but mtg sucks 
2018-11-06 10:32:59	+Khorne	or you suck at shuffling
2018-11-06 10:33:04	@enju	been here 25 years and is still growing
2018-11-06 10:33:14	@enju	mtg is by far the best tgc
2018-11-06 10:33:19	Ergo	if they removed the rng based way you get mana it would be a good game 
2018-11-06 10:33:30	+Khorne	no it would be a boring game
2018-11-06 10:33:33	+Khorne	like hs
2018-11-06 10:33:35	@enju	its not even rng
2018-11-06 10:33:36	+Rue	other card games just lack depth and sophistication when compared to magic :P
2018-11-06 10:33:51	Ergo	I really think Gwent has alot of potential right now 
2018-11-06 10:33:55	+Wug	o
2018-11-06 10:33:59	+Rue	most card games are just creatures trading blows, blocking, etc
2018-11-06 10:34:09	Ergo	not gwent tho :) 
2018-11-06 10:34:10	+Khorne	gwent is not even comparable in game mechanics tho
2018-11-06 10:34:13	Ergo	yee
2018-11-06 10:34:17	Ergo	mechanics are entirely different 
2018-11-06 10:34:29	Ergo	it doesnt even have a face to hit 
2018-11-06 10:34:31	+Khorne	while hs is comparable to mtg or w/e
2018-11-06 10:36:16	bgiannan	#beets being silent, does any of you uses it ?
2018-11-06 10:36:32	+Rue	maybe it's better to just play chess/go
2018-11-06 10:36:41	Ergo	#beets? 
2018-11-06 10:36:53	Ergo	i was wondering if there was a decent anime irc

2018-11-06 10:38:00	+Rue	enju: i feel like it's kind of pointless when people just follow popular openings
2018-11-06 10:38:14	workodera	test one two
2018-11-06 10:38:16	+Rue	and ya, there's also people that use those ai programs to see what the next move is (i hear)
2018-11-06 10:38:19	@enju	still OP, 5% higher winrate
2018-11-06 10:38:28	+Khorne	pls nerf rito
2018-11-06 10:38:42	+Rue	go seems awesome.... but a real game with 18x18 board. it just takes way too fucking long to play. i aint got the time for that lol
2018-11-06 10:38:45	+Rue	nor the patience

2018-11-06 10:42:29	Ergo	workodera: were you the "lead" of 6c37? 
2018-11-06 10:42:36	+Wug	@!!!!!
2018-11-06 10:42:55	workodera	Ergo, kind of yes
2018-11-06 10:43:02	+Rue	what's 6c37? is that the monero thingy you were creating?
2018-11-06 10:43:07	workodera	"officially" kori was, however he stopped using crux
2018-11-06 10:43:15	+Rue	oh nvm it's crux related
2018-11-06 10:43:27	workodera	me and xeirrrr/ltlanceroad did most of of the work, however lt suddenly vanished
2018-11-06 10:43:34	Ergo	yeee i was so confused 
2018-11-06 10:43:46	Ergo	like i installed crux after some time recenly and the repo was gone 
2018-11-06 10:43:47	workodera	and I didn't hsave the time anymore to keep all these [prts up to date
2018-11-06 10:43:47	Ergo	sad days 
2018-11-06 10:44:05	Ergo	that makes sense, i was thinking of adopting some as well 
2018-11-06 10:44:15	workodera	the ports are still in the repo
2018-11-06 10:44:18	Ergo	are you gonna list your repo on the crux page? 
2018-11-06 10:44:31	workodera	probably quite easy to adopt them
2018-11-06 10:44:55	workodera	I thought it already was, but I think the ports page maintainer forgot about it, I'll mail them again
2018-11-06 10:45:05	Ergo	ye see, you adopted slop and main. i was doing manually yesterday lol 
2018-11-06 10:45:18	Ergo	ahhh sure, well thanks for the link :) 
2018-11-06 10:47:12	Ergo	will the httpup file just use onodera as the folder name? 
2018-11-06 10:49:36	workodera	I don't use httpup
2018-11-06 10:49:39	workodera	i think
2018-11-06 10:49:48	Ergo	ah so i just git clone it, allright 
2018-11-06 10:49:58	workodera	Ergo, https://github.com/6c37/cross/tree/master/git-driver

2018-11-06 10:50:03	workodera	try this
2018-11-06 10:50:16	workodera	it's a git driver for ports
2018-11-06 10:50:46	Ergo	never seen that before, i will look into it

2018-11-06 10:51:12	Ergo	is it possible to include that when doing ports -u? 
2018-11-06 10:51:16	workodera	just modify one of the .git files in that repo to correspond to the new repo
2018-11-06 10:51:40	workodera	yes, using this you can pull in ports from git using ports -u
2018-11-06 10:51:51	Ergo	lol, my qyestion was the first thing on the page 
2018-11-06 10:52:00	Ergo	well i will stop bothering you for now , u helped alot 
2018-11-06 10:52:30	workodera	oh right, I think the git port now creates the git driver
2018-11-06 10:53:33	@enju	just spend more money on an antiquated music medium AMA
2018-11-06 10:53:56	workodera	enju, mp3s?

2018-11-06 10:54:28	workodera	I'm kind of doing the vinyl thing but with books
2018-11-06 10:54:43	workodera	I wnane create a nice book shelf and buy a comfy chair
2018-11-06 10:54:47	+Rue	it's always nice to have a bookcase full of books
2018-11-06 10:54:49	@enju	I buy books used exclusivly
2018-11-06 10:55:01	@enju	saves so much fucking money
2018-11-06 10:55:08	workodera	does it really?
2018-11-06 10:55:13	+Rue	for me, buying english versions of books in taiwan costs more. so i'm sadly stuck with ebooks
2018-11-06 10:55:16	workodera	compared to what enju 
2018-11-06 10:55:34	@enju	buying them new
2018-11-06 10:55:35	workodera	Rue, amazon here is p cheap, 10 dollar for most books
2018-11-06 10:55:47	+Rue	no amazon in taiwan
2018-11-06 10:55:48	workodera	oh I miss the "used" part
2018-11-06 10:55:49	+Rue	only in china

2018-11-06 10:56:42	+Rue	ya amazon used books are great. i used to use that when i was still living in the states
2018-11-06 10:56:55	workodera	The thing is I want nice hardcover books, but they're so hard to find (some)
2018-11-06 10:57:10	workodera	or there is only one and they cost 200+ eur
2018-11-06 10:57:43	@enju	I really dont care, I mostly sell them right back after reading them
2018-11-06 10:57:52	workodera	ehh
2018-11-06 10:57:58	+Rue	if you keep all your books so clean people are going to tthink you never eve read them kek
2018-11-06 10:58:03	@enju	I still have to sell off all the fantasy books I used to like when I was 15
2018-11-06 10:58:28	workodera	i was really into fantasy
2018-11-06 10:58:40	@enju	same

2018-11-06 10:59:34	@enju	most shit people read here are thrillers / crime stories, and by far the most popular ones are all swedish

2018-11-06 10:59:59	workodera	I haven't, it's very confusing right?

2018-11-06 11:00:12	Ergo	i started on the first book recently, its pretty good 
2018-11-06 11:00:21	Ergo	but like i wonder if its gonna be new characters every book and whatnot 
2018-11-06 11:00:38	Ergo	i feel like it will become a huge clusterfuck somewere down the line 
2018-11-06 11:00:50	workodera	I was really into Raymond E. Feist
2018-11-06 11:00:53	@enju	my fav fantasy series is "The Dwarfs" series by Markus Heitz

2018-11-06 11:09:47	workodera	this argument forces me to basically believe in god or either I'm just an incoherent mess
2018-11-06 11:10:17	@enju	I dont think so, never heard of that

2018-11-06 11:11:10	workodera	The argument is basically "If naturalist evolution is true, our brains are selected for survival rather than truth, but that means we can't really trust our brains, including any conclusions about naturalist evolution."
2018-11-06 11:11:29	@enju	I dont see how that forces you to believe in god
2018-11-06 11:11:48	workodera	see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_argument_against_naturalism#C.S._Lewis_framing

2018-11-06 11:12:54	@enju	okay lets spin it, you also have no reason to believe in god either
2018-11-06 11:13:21	@enju	his example just uses god as the pretense and you have to prove he doesnt exist
2018-11-06 11:13:35	@enju	I can spin that and use the same argument that you cant prove that he indeed does exist
2018-11-06 11:13:54	@enju	and whatever you say I cant trust your thoughts nor mine, and therefore have no reason to believe in god
2018-11-06 11:14:01	@enju	w e a k argument
2018-11-06 11:14:22	workodera	eh I don't know, I thinkt the five proofs by aquinas are compelling, but  I could always conceptualize a world without god
2018-11-06 11:16:21	Ergo	lol, ye i agree with enju here 
2018-11-06 11:16:54	workodera	now the second choice is also incoherent to a certain degree, anyways I don't know man
2018-11-06 11:17:19	 *	Wug 
2018-11-06 11:19:25	@enju	I dont see the need for a god

2018-11-06 11:21:20	workodera	i don't know
2018-11-06 11:24:16	+Wug	i mean
2018-11-06 11:24:28	+Wug	you can just choose not to decide because ultimately it doesn't matter and isn't worth discussing 
2018-11-06 11:24:33	+Wug	its unprovable
2018-11-06 11:24:56	@enju	I think its worth discussing, but yeah, its not provable
2018-11-06 11:24:58	+Wug	always remeber you can perpetually remain undecided 
2018-11-06 11:25:00	@enju	atleast yet
2018-11-06 11:25:27	+Wug	its too abstract to argue 
2018-11-06 11:25:30	+Khorne	Wug, yes we call that agnostic
2018-11-06 11:25:46	+Wug	Khorne: sort of
2018-11-06 11:26:00	+Khorne	No pretty much exactly
2018-11-06 11:26:12	@enju	.np
2018-11-06 11:26:13	+cappuccino	enju (nilejo) is now playing ATTENTION by Joji
2018-11-06 11:26:15	+Khorne	Cant be proven, cant be disproven, also has no influence on me whatsoever
2018-11-06 11:26:18	@enju	this album is a banger
2018-11-06 11:26:19	+Wug	Khorne: but sort of a level further, not only is it being undecided but not being sure about that unto itself
2018-11-06 11:26:22	+Wug	:^)
2018-11-06 11:26:34	+Khorne	You are..not sure about being undecided?
2018-11-06 11:26:39	+Wug	yes
2018-11-06 11:26:43	+Khorne	Right.
2018-11-06 11:26:48	@enju	Khorne thing is, you should still form an opinion on it because it has a big influence on a lot of people and by extension you
2018-11-06 11:26:56	Ergo	well thats odd Wug 
2018-11-06 11:26:58	+Wug	i disgaree
2018-11-06 11:27:09	Ergo	i just dont believe in its existence, never had a rreason to 
2018-11-06 11:27:26	+Khorne	enju, my opinion is that the whole discussion is entirely irrelevant and any effort spent on it is wasted
2018-11-06 11:27:36	+Wug	i posit that by not forming an opinion on it you can remain more objective on the matter
2018-11-06 11:27:48	+Wug	Khorne: im unsure about that statement
2018-11-06 11:28:04	+Khorne	Im pretty sure thats exactly my opinion
2018-11-06 11:28:28	 *	Wug is unsure
2018-11-06 11:28:48	+Khorne	Im also of the opionion that organized religion should be punishable by death
2018-11-06 11:28:54	+Khorne	*opinion
2018-11-06 11:29:11	 *	Wug is unsure if wug is unsure about death being death
2018-11-06 11:30:56	+Wug	Khorne: also the reason i have this dum philsophy thing is bc im unsure about freewill being a thing
2018-11-06 11:31:04	+Wug	so just add another layer of meta and its all ok
2018-11-06 11:31:05	Ergo	oh noey 
2018-11-06 11:31:20	+Khorne	Wug, no thats quite nice actually, you dont have to do anything then
2018-11-06 11:31:28	+Wug	yep
2018-11-06 11:31:32	Ergo	dont have to think about anything 
2018-11-06 11:31:34	Ergo	nice :) 
2018-11-06 11:31:37	+Khorne	And remember kids
2018-11-06 11:31:39	+Wug	its pretty good
2018-11-06 11:31:51	+Khorne	Everything you ever do at any point is futile in the long run
2018-11-06 11:32:00	 *	Wug is unsure about that statement
2018-11-06 11:32:07	Ergo	Nothing matters, all the deciscions are already made for ya 
2018-11-06 11:32:14	+Khorne	The heat death of the universe is inevitable
2018-11-06 11:32:27	+Wug	only problem with adhereing to this school of thought is everything gets really abstract real quik
2018-11-06 11:32:35	+Wug	i spend most of my time trying to think about thinking
2018-11-06 11:32:41	+Khorne	Dont hurt yourself tbh
2018-11-06 11:32:46	@enju	just do acid and masturbate tbh
2018-11-06 11:32:50	Ergo	Khorne lol 
2018-11-06 11:32:51	+Khorne	^
2018-11-06 11:32:54	+Wug	wew
2018-11-06 11:32:54	+cappuccino	w e w l a d
2018-11-06 11:33:00	+Wug	wug lad
2018-11-06 11:33:36	+Wug	see the trick is people can't disagree with you if they aren't sure if you have any opinion on a matter at all
2018-11-06 11:34:00	+Khorne	See you can make this even easier
2018-11-06 11:34:10	+Khorne	Have an opinion or not, doesnt matter if you just dont talk to people
2018-11-06 11:34:19	+Khorne	I really like that method
2018-11-06 11:34:22	+Wug	well it does
2018-11-06 11:34:27	+Wug	bc im unsure if people exist
2018-11-06 11:34:33	+Khorne	They dont
2018-11-06 11:34:33	+Wug	or if opinions exist
2018-11-06 11:34:34	Ergo	you are trolling us right? 
2018-11-06 11:34:42	+Khorne	They dont either
2018-11-06 11:34:42	+Wug	Ergo: honestly
2018-11-06 11:34:44	+Khorne	Ergo, no he is always that way
2018-11-06 11:34:44	+Wug	im unsure 
2018-11-06 11:34:48	+Khorne	Was dropped a few times or his mom did acid 
2018-11-06 11:34:53	+Khorne	were not sure yet
2018-11-06 11:35:04	+Wug	Khorne: i just like being meta and things
2018-11-06 11:35:13	+Khorne	being meta for the sake of metaness
2018-11-06 11:35:16	Ergo	this is not meta, this is just dumb
2018-11-06 11:35:19	+Khorne	^
2018-11-06 11:35:22	+Wug	Ergo: prove it
2018-11-06 11:35:24	+Khorne	literally adds nothing
2018-11-06 11:35:26	workodera	Ergo, Wug, make sure to think about this every time you make a bad decisioon
2018-11-06 11:35:31	+Wug	Khorne: yea but thats the point
2018-11-06 11:35:37	Ergo	ye, i dont think i wanna get more into this discussion 
2018-11-06 11:35:44	+Khorne	Wug, is this the same point as "nazis werent really evil?"
2018-11-06 11:35:48	+Wug	its sort of a form of cynicism positing that most arguments are beyond not worthwhile
2018-11-06 11:35:55	workodera	"it's not *really* my fault, I mean free will isn't a thing so I couldn't have done anything differently"
2018-11-06 11:36:07	+Wug	t. determinist
2018-11-06 11:36:09	+Wug	Khorne: im not sure
2018-11-06 11:36:11	Ergo	wait
2018-11-06 11:36:15	Ergo	he said nazis werent evil? 
2018-11-06 11:36:20	+Wug	also id ont remeber actually saying nazis did nothing wrong
2018-11-06 11:36:30	+Wug	Ergo: i think so but but iw as argumeting that the term evil is ill defined
2018-11-06 11:36:42	Ergo	thats even worse 
2018-11-06 11:36:59	Ergo	Like if you said not all nazis were evil because brainwashed from childhood yada yada i could get it 
2018-11-06 11:37:10	Ergo	but the upper echelon nazis were definitely evil 
2018-11-06 11:37:17	+Wug	well
2018-11-06 11:37:24	+Khorne	Conversations with Cosumu degrade into "Has Anyone Really Been Far Even as Decided to Use Even Go Want to do Look More Like" territory real quick usually
2018-11-06 11:37:27	+Wug	Ergo: i mean the statement is so widely said it means very little
2018-11-06 11:37:30	workodera	Ergo, in your subjective opinion?
2018-11-06 11:37:46	Ergo	workodera: reeeeeeeeeeeee
2018-11-06 11:38:04	+Khorne	Ergo, dont mind workodera, he is the resident altright whackjob
2018-11-06 11:38:11	+Wug	i mean the other day i was discussing the artistic merit of the works of art of the national socialist movement and people were saying 'hitler is evil'
2018-11-06 11:38:13	+Wug	'ur a nazi'
2018-11-06 11:38:26	+Wug	but nazism was effectively outside the scope of the discussion, iwas only concerend about the art
2018-11-06 11:38:32	Ergo	i mean, i agree that who made the art doesnt have to define the beauty of art 
2018-11-06 11:38:34	workodera	this was menat to take a shot at moral relativism Khorne 
2018-11-06 11:38:37	Ergo	but thats something entirely different 
2018-11-06 11:38:58	 *	Wug is unsure
2018-11-06 11:39:24	Ergo	not having a opinion on stuff is just like being to afraid to actually stand for anything lol 
2018-11-06 11:39:36	+Khorne	Wug, considering that art without a frame of reference or context is meaning in itself does make the discussion also about nazism tbh
2018-11-06 11:39:37	Ergo	or to afraid to decide what you are as a person 
2018-11-06 11:39:38	+Wug	Ergo: no
2018-11-06 11:39:42	+Khorne	meaningless*
2018-11-06 11:39:47	@enju	free will and determinism gives me headaches
2018-11-06 11:39:56	Ergo	people just are man 
2018-11-06 11:39:59	+Khorne	enju, no, god gave you a headache
2018-11-06 11:40:03	+Khorne	smh
2018-11-06 11:40:10	+Khorne	you cant give yourslef a headache if no free will
2018-11-06 11:40:14	+Wug	i dont think it had anything to do with nazism i was just enjoying art
2018-11-06 11:40:41	Ergo	do you know whats funny 
2018-11-06 11:40:54	Ergo	im forced to use a dark theme on my desktop at all times because else my monitor gets burn in 
2018-11-06 11:40:58	@enju	Khorne I mean you dont need god for determinism, but yeah
2018-11-06 11:41:01	+Khorne	Wug, as I said, art without a social and/or political context is meaningless
2018-11-06 11:41:01	+Wug	Ergo: i mean its also a case of i dont nessiiarly want to stand for anything and im just disucsing things for the sake of discussing them
2018-11-06 11:41:15	+Wug	Khorne: but i wasn't looking for meaning
2018-11-06 11:41:21	Ergo	what makes you a person then if you dont wanna stand for anything or have a opinion on stuff 
2018-11-06 11:41:24	@enju	Khorne is pure aesthetic for the purpose of aesthetic not also art
2018-11-06 11:41:32	workodera	enju, I think you need god for the world to not be deterministic
2018-11-06 11:41:38	+Wug	Ergo: being a person
2018-11-06 11:41:43	+Khorne	enju, if you use padding in the next two sentences imma leave :')
2018-11-06 11:41:45	+Khorne	and im not coming back :p
2018-11-06 11:41:52	workodera	it is just impossible for a physicical brain to create a first cause out of nothing
2018-11-06 11:41:58	+Wug	Ergo: you are saying being objective is in conflict with being human
2018-11-06 11:42:03	+Khorne	Yes
2018-11-06 11:42:06	+Khorne	It is
2018-11-06 11:42:08	+Wug	workodera: i've seen this arugmetn before and i disagree
2018-11-06 11:42:15	@enju	Khorne I was more thinking design, esp graphic design, or some forms of contemporary photographt and painting, but yeah
2018-11-06 11:42:19	@enju	rice works too :')
2018-11-06 11:42:27	Ergo	lets all just talk about rice 
2018-11-06 11:42:39	+Wug	workodera: define nothing
2018-11-06 11:42:43	Ergo	https://github.com/dkeg/crayolo
2018-11-06 11:42:44	+cappuccino	[ github.com ] GitHub - dkeg/crayolo: few colors from the collection (text/html)
2018-11-06 11:42:50	Ergo	these colorschemes are pretty nice 
2018-11-06 11:42:51	+Wug	workodera: bingo ur argument is defunct
2018-11-06 11:42:55	+Khorne	enju, even so I think
2018-11-06 11:43:00	@enju	Ergo I miss dkeg ;_;
2018-11-06 11:43:10	Ergo	did he used to be in here? 
2018-11-06 11:43:28	@enju	nah, but i havent seen him around in dtop threads or r/up in ages
2018-11-06 11:43:36	Ergo	dtop threads? 
2018-11-06 11:43:39	Ergo	where can i find those 
2018-11-06 11:43:42	workodera	Wug, there being no previous cause
2018-11-06 11:43:44	@enju	dunno if he is still nixxers #unix
2018-11-06 11:43:50	+Wug	do you ever spend time deeply in thought thinking of nothing at all
2018-11-06 11:43:58	Ergo	is the #nixers place still active? 
2018-11-06 11:44:07	@enju	was it ever really active
2018-11-06 11:44:09	Ergo	i think im in the forum, never looked into joining the irc 
2018-11-06 11:44:21	Ergo	I saw some nice workflow video by that z3bra guide 
2018-11-06 11:44:22	@enju	Wug oxymoron
2018-11-06 11:44:39	+Wug	enju: i disagree
2018-11-06 11:44:53	workodera	Wug, this is kind of spiritual talk, if you conceptualize the world as being purely physical it is impossible to "will" a cause out of nothingness.
2018-11-06 11:44:59	+Wug	enju: do you not ever feel like you are deep in thought but your mind seems to be blank?
2018-11-06 11:45:14	+Wug	workodera: i never said i believe in will
2018-11-06 11:45:15	@enju	yeah but you are deep in thought
2018-11-06 11:45:25	+Khorne	deep in thought about your mind being blank
2018-11-06 11:45:26	@enju	its not _nothing_
2018-11-06 11:45:28	Ergo	enju: link me to those dtop threads -_-
2018-11-06 11:45:37	@enju	Ergo /wg/ still has them
2018-11-06 11:45:42	+Wug	its like
2018-11-06 11:45:46	+Wug	trying to think what im thinking about
2018-11-06 11:45:46	@enju	after /g/ banned them
2018-11-06 11:45:48	+Wug	its hard
2018-11-06 11:45:49	Ergo	i wanna browse rice related stuff without being spammed with i3 and gnome reee
2018-11-06 11:45:59	@enju	Wug thats called mindfulness and takes time to train
2018-11-06 11:46:14	+Wug	enju: it wasn't intentional
2018-11-06 11:46:16	+Khorne	enju, and yea I do actually think graphic design is influenced as well
2018-11-06 11:46:20	+Wug	i was trying to think abou ttihnking about something concrete
2018-11-06 11:46:36	@enju	ive been activly practicing this shit for a year now and I cant even manage to concentrate on 20 consecutive breaths
2018-11-06 11:46:37	+Khorne	enju, eg look at ads from the 50s or something, all bright and future happy after the wars
2018-11-06 11:46:43	+Wug	it wasn't an exercise in introspection by any means
2018-11-06 11:47:12	+Khorne	enju, thing about contemporary is that its prolly less evaluated/analyzed just yet
2018-11-06 11:47:26	@enju	Khorne plenty of purely aesthetic things. you could still argue that most of these things still have somewhat the purpose to cause an emotion or association
2018-11-06 11:48:16	+Khorne	Well, naturally
2018-11-06 11:48:27	Ergo	i mean its a thing with art 
2018-11-06 11:48:43	@enju	but yeah, I think what you are getting at is if its art if there was no intention by the artist
2018-11-06 11:48:48	Ergo	even in stuff like anime, were sometimes the anime is amazing but the dude who created it turns out to be some crazy pedo 
2018-11-06 11:48:55	@enju	how its perceived != intention of the artist
2018-11-06 11:48:59	+Khorne	enju, but what about the changed of whats perceived as aesthetic over the decades/centuries?
2018-11-06 11:49:08	+Khorne	ah yea
2018-11-06 11:49:09	+Wug	sometimes i wonder if im just a word salad
2018-11-06 11:49:19	+Wug	workodera: can a word salad ever be self aware?
2018-11-06 11:49:21	+Khorne	but purely in terms of aesthecity
2018-11-06 11:50:05	+Khorne	Like take renaissance era art..I doubt that would be widely considered as 'aesthetic' in todays times
2018-11-06 11:50:21	+Khorne	It would be considered as aesthetic *for the time*
2018-11-06 11:50:27	@enju	it could still be purely made for aesthetic reason though with no actual itnent
2018-11-06 11:50:33	+Khorne	well true
2018-11-06 11:50:34	workodera	what do you mean with aesthetic?
2018-11-06 11:50:38	workodera	I think it is aesthetic
2018-11-06 11:50:52	@enju	its still aesthetic, just not our current "taste"
2018-11-06 11:51:04	+Khorne	'widely considered'
2018-11-06 11:51:15	@enju	and something purely created for aesthetic and no actual intent or meaning is still art
2018-11-06 11:51:31	@enju	but then you still have intent, shit
2018-11-06 11:51:38	+Wug	HMM
2018-11-06 11:51:40	+Khorne	Aesthetics (/?s???t?ks, i?s-/) is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature of art, beauty, and taste, with the creation and appreciation of beauty.[1]
2018-11-06 11:51:41	+Wug	odd thought
2018-11-06 11:51:42	@enju	so yah, no intent by the artist = no art
2018-11-06 11:51:43	+Khorne	In its more technical epistemological perspective, it is defined as the study of subjective and sensori-emotional values, sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste.
2018-11-06 11:51:45	+Khorne	;<
2018-11-06 11:51:46	+Khorne	"sentiment and taste"
2018-11-06 11:51:53	+Wug	i disagree
2018-11-06 11:51:53	workodera	enju, that's probably what all these copy paste artists try to do nowadays
2018-11-06 11:51:58	workodera	try to create something without meaning
2018-11-06 11:52:00	+Wug	an artwork made my a computer just sold
2018-11-06 11:52:03	workodera	of without intent
2018-11-06 11:52:04	+Wug	that has no meaning
2018-11-06 11:52:06	workodera	which then becomes the intent
2018-11-06 11:52:08	+Wug	and no intent
2018-11-06 11:52:13	+Wug	:^)
2018-11-06 11:52:16	@enju	workodera I think the intent is sales
2018-11-06 11:52:19	@enju	:')
2018-11-06 11:52:21	workodera	ah right
2018-11-06 11:52:24	workodera	also a possibility lol
2018-11-06 11:52:25	+Khorne	Wug, naturally it has a meaning
2018-11-06 11:52:28	@enju	look at instagram photography
2018-11-06 11:52:28	+Khorne	Even an intent
2018-11-06 11:52:45	@enju	workodera most of the shit that works these days is conjuring nostalgia
2018-11-06 11:52:47	+Wug	i suppose i have no trouble appreciating nazi art becuase i hve trouble even assosiating the concepts of hilter and who he was
2018-11-06 11:52:50	+Wug	its so abstract
2018-11-06 11:53:36	+Khorne	What is abstract about it..
2018-11-06 11:53:41	@enju	specific intents also disqualifies things as art imo
2018-11-06 11:53:58	+Khorne	enju, wdym
2018-11-06 11:54:05	@enju	f.e. ads
2018-11-06 11:54:10	+Khorne	you consider that propaganda?

2018-11-06 14:59:18	Ergo	i actually havent used both yet, but emacs seems like a OS within your OS 
2018-11-06 14:59:25	+Rue	kinda wanna try using latex to keep notes of stuff from reading
2018-11-06 14:59:26	Ergo	while markdown seems super ez 
2018-11-06 14:59:36	Ergo	latex seems hella complicated lol 
2018-11-06 14:59:46	+Rue	and auctex i hear is pretty good, it's for latex
2018-11-06 14:59:50	jenkins	yeah I use md more than latex now
2018-11-06 14:59:56	+nuuxe	emacs is the endgame editor
2018-11-06 15:00:04	+nuuxe	auctex is legit

2018-11-06 15:00:27	@enju	Rue just use markdown for that tbh

2018-11-06 15:01:02	+nuuxe	bgiannan: STOP RIGHT THERE

2018-11-06 15:01:22	bgiannan	i spent quite a lot of time trying to use emacs and then vim
2018-11-06 15:01:26	bgiannan	both are too slow
2018-11-06 15:01:33	bgiannan	when you start to do shit with them

2018-11-06 15:01:40	jenkins	Ergo: nothing too advanced for now.. I write notes in markdown with vim, and then I compile them in pdf with pandoc, by pressing F9

2018-11-06 15:23:53	@enju	there are cli tools that can do that
2018-11-06 15:24:04	+aesthetik	but why 
2018-11-06 15:24:04	@enju	but why do that if I could have it integrated into my IDE tbh
2018-11-06 15:24:16	+aesthetik	but why do any of that if you can just click an issue and click close
2018-11-06 15:24:19	+aesthetik	i dont get it
2018-11-06 15:24:30	@enju	because that would mean I would have to click on something
2018-11-06 15:24:33	+aesthetik	like git operations i get, they can be long winded and annoying
2018-11-06 15:24:36	+aesthetik	but closing an issue?
2018-11-06 15:24:37	+aesthetik	pffffft
2018-11-06 15:24:38	@enju	and open it in my browser
2018-11-06 15:24:43	+aesthetik	waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
2018-11-06 15:24:54	+aesthetik	"you mean i have to go to the issue tracker to manage issues?"
2018-11-06 15:24:55	+aesthetik	lmao
2018-11-06 15:25:00	@enju	instead of having the project added to my IDE, just hit a button combination and browse and close issues that way
2018-11-06 15:25:54	@enju	or the second best way, lemme browse issues from the command line and do it that way
2018-11-06 15:26:10	+aesthetik	that's even worse imo but i guess to each his own
2018-11-06 15:26:22	+aesthetik	i like githubs approach of having issue tracking and prs and everything all in one interface
2018-11-06 15:28:07	+Khorne	Ergo, yes
2018-11-06 15:28:12	+Khorne	Its p much inverse wine
2018-11-06 15:29:17	+nuuxe	emacs has magithub for github integration. it's p cool but I haven't used it much tho
2018-11-06 15:29:32	+nuuxe	issues and PRs work
2018-11-06 15:30:24	+nuuxe	really neat to edit a file, select a hunk in buffer to stage, commit it and make a PR all in one place and with same keybinds
2018-11-06 15:31:07	@Leliana	or just use jetbrains IDEs
2018-11-06 15:32:04	+nuuxe	but I'm got going to have proper emacs keybinds and hjkl in it
2018-11-06 15:32:11	+nuuxe	also I would have to pay for it
2018-11-06 15:32:13	@Leliana	>what is vim plugin
2018-11-06 15:32:15	@Leliana	>what is emacs plugin
2018-11-06 15:32:21	@Leliana	um, no?
2018-11-06 15:32:41	+nuuxe	do you seriously think that emacs/vim plugin will work for each shortcut?
2018-11-06 15:33:04	+nuuxe	there's VsVim plugin for VS2017 but it only works for editing text
2018-11-06 15:33:38	@Leliana	you realise emacs is just a control scheme, right?
2018-11-06 15:33:47	@Leliana	you can configure it just as much as any other keybind
2018-11-06 15:34:08	@Leliana	and the vim plugins works fine with vimrc
2018-11-06 15:34:20	+aesthetik	.np
2018-11-06 15:34:20	+cappuccino	aesthetik (zack6849) is now playing Stacy's Mom by Fountains of Wayne
2018-11-06 15:34:22	+nuuxe	will it have helm and org-mode in it?
2018-11-06 15:34:32	+aesthetik	nuuxe: phpstorm already has php syntax hilighting
2018-11-06 15:34:35	+aesthetik	why use org mode
2018-11-06 15:34:37	+aesthetik	which is shittier
2018-11-06 15:34:44	+aesthetik	wait or is that company mode
2018-11-06 15:34:48	+nuuxe	for notes?
2018-11-06 15:34:49	+aesthetik	hold on i might be a retard
2018-11-06 15:34:54	@Leliana	aesthetik: "might be"
2018-11-06 15:34:58	+nuuxe	it's ok
2018-11-06 15:35:01	+aesthetik	>:c
2018-11-06 15:35:13	+aesthetik	ah yeah i confused org and company mode
2018-11-06 15:35:21	+aesthetik	company mode is the syntax hilighting portion
2018-11-06 15:35:31	+nuuxe	company mode is for completion
2018-11-06 15:35:34	+nuuxe	not highlighting
2018-11-06 15:35:36	+aesthetik	oh w/e
2018-11-06 15:35:43	+aesthetik	either way i was confusing it for that
2018-11-06 15:35:45	+aesthetik	shhh
2018-11-06 15:35:49	@Leliana	phpstorm is objectively the best editor for PHP
2018-11-06 15:35:52	+aesthetik	 i only used emacs like 4 times
2018-11-06 15:35:55	@Leliana	you can hack together all the emacs configs you want
2018-11-06 15:35:58	@Leliana	doesn't even come close :)
2018-11-06 15:36:07	+aesthetik	Leliana: our indian devs use some weird shit that i didnt dare ask the name of
2018-11-06 15:36:11	+aesthetik	and it's only in light theme
2018-11-06 15:36:20	@Leliana	aesthetik: notepad?
2018-11-06 15:36:27	+aesthetik	no it tried to be an actual IDE
2018-11-06 15:36:29	+nuuxe	probably PoopStorm
2018-11-06 15:36:29	+aesthetik	but it wasnt
2018-11-06 15:36:32	@Leliana	oh, netbeans then
2018-11-06 15:36:40	+aesthetik	no i know what fucking netbeans looks like
2018-11-06 15:36:57	@Leliana	you know what the default appearance of netbeans looks like
2018-11-06 15:37:09	+aesthetik	i know what netbeans can look like and it was not netbeans
2018-11-06 15:37:13	+aesthetik	not even the logo was netbeans
2018-11-06 15:37:38	bgiannan	eclipse
2018-11-06 15:37:39	+aesthetik	also, netbeans honestly isnt terrible
2018-11-06 15:37:40	+aesthetik	stop bully
2018-11-06 15:37:42	@Leliana	aesthetik: remember when we used to use netbeans :')
2018-11-06 15:37:44	+nuuxe	why the fuck it's called netbeans?
2018-11-06 15:37:47	@Leliana	before we discovered idea
2018-11-06 15:37:47	+aesthetik	i also know what eclipse looks like
2018-11-06 15:37:53	+aesthetik	nuuxe: because it's for java primarily
2018-11-06 15:37:54	bgiannan	like shit
2018-11-06 15:37:54	+aesthetik	java beans
2018-11-06 15:37:56	+aesthetik	net beans
2018-11-06 15:37:57	bgiannan	it looks like shit
2018-11-06 15:37:58	+aesthetik	ha
2018-11-06 15:37:58	@Leliana	my first plugin was made in eclipse :')
2018-11-06 15:38:00	+aesthetik	hahah
2018-11-06 15:38:03	<--	pfallenop (~pfallenop@57B5CCDA.A05B7943.6BA3CC9D.IP) has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2018-11-06 15:38:07	+nuuxe	oh java beans
2018-11-06 15:38:08	+nuuxe	wew
2018-11-06 15:38:10	+nuuxe	i c
2018-11-06 15:38:10	+aesthetik	i've used eclipse, netbeans, IDEA, etc
2018-11-06 15:38:24	+aesthetik	they're all acceptable but jetbrains is the best imo
2018-11-06 15:38:26	+aesthetik	though i will say
2018-11-06 15:38:31	@Leliana	>imo
2018-11-06 15:38:35	+aesthetik	i sort of miss the idea of all my projects being open at once
2018-11-06 15:38:38	@Leliana	no it is objectively the best
2018-11-06 15:38:43	+aesthetik	and just being able to open a folder and view them
2018-11-06 15:38:48	bgiannan	also java
2018-11-06 15:38:50	@Leliana	File > Open
2018-11-06 15:38:52	@Leliana	????
2018-11-06 15:38:55	+aesthetik	i know you can sort of jerry rig that with that and modules
2018-11-06 15:38:57	+aesthetik	Leliana: not all at once
2018-11-06 15:38:59	+nuuxe	I heard emacs has a nice java major-mode :^)
2018-11-06 15:39:03	+aesthetik	like a project viewer like they all have lol
2018-11-06 15:39:07	+nuuxe	also ycmd supports completion for java
2018-11-06 15:39:14	@Leliana	nuuxe: have you ever tried to write java in a text editor?
2018-11-06 15:39:21	@Leliana	I don't care how good completions are
2018-11-06 15:39:25	@Leliana	it's total shit
2018-11-06 15:39:31	bgiannan	a single 'tab' sends your cpu to space
2018-11-06 15:39:33	@enju	have you tried to do anything that is OOP with a texteditor
2018-11-06 15:39:35	+aesthetik	lole
2018-11-06 15:39:38	+nuuxe	I haven't tried to write java because it's total shit
2018-11-06 15:39:38	@enju	no thanks
2018-11-06 15:39:46	+nuuxe	but I would assume it's like C#, so yeah
2018-11-06 15:39:53	+aesthetik	nuuxe: waaa
2018-11-06 15:39:58	@Leliana	>java is total shit
2018-11-06 15:40:00	@Leliana	>but C# is ok
2018-11-06 15:40:02	@Leliana	l m a o
2018-11-06 15:40:02	+aesthetik	>has never written java
2018-11-06 15:40:04	+aesthetik	>is shit
2018-11-06 15:40:05	+aesthetik	ok
2018-11-06 15:40:13	@Leliana	aesthetik: good ol cargo cults :')
2018-11-06 15:40:16	+aesthetik	guys x86 assembler is garbage
2018-11-06 15:40:26	+aesthetik	ive never used it but who needs 1600 lines of code for a calculator tbh
2018-11-06 15:40:45	+aesthetik	Leliana: see #rust
2018-11-06 15:40:49	@enju	guys C is garbage, like it doesnt even manage memory for you
2018-11-06 15:40:49	+nuuxe	aesthetik: s-shut up I have an o-opinion!
2018-11-06 15:40:55	+aesthetik	wait where the fuck is LambdaComplex he hasnt mentioned my sister in several months
2018-11-06 15:40:57	+aesthetik	did he die
2018-11-06 15:41:08	@Leliana	nuuxe: yes it's just that your opinion is wrong
2018-11-06 15:41:10	+aesthetik	nuuxe: an opinion in a language you've never used
2018-11-06 15:41:13	+Khorne	guys java is garbage, who needs 4 million chracter long function names
2018-11-06 15:41:15	-->	pfallenop (~pfallenop@57B5CCDA.A05B7943.6BA3CC9D.IP) has joined #rice
2018-11-06 15:41:16	+aesthetik	thus your opinion doesnt matter
2018-11-06 15:41:25	@Leliana	honestly 99% of java myths today are from like...1.5/6 era
2018-11-06 15:41:34	bgiannan	are they ?
2018-11-06 15:41:35	+LambdaComplex	aesthetik: i actually considered adding her on facebook last week
2018-11-06 15:41:38	+aesthetik	and yet you still bully me for liking java >:c
2018-11-06 15:41:44	@enju	Leliana its still an inefficient memory hog tbh
2018-11-06 15:41:49	@Leliana	>inefficient
2018-11-06 15:41:50	+nuuxe	well, judging from syntax, java is unnecessary bulky
2018-11-06 15:41:51	@Leliana	nah sorry fam
2018-11-06 15:41:53	bgiannan	i know that java has now 1000000000 more useless features than 3 years ago
2018-11-06 15:41:53	+nuuxe	compared to C#
2018-11-06 15:41:58	+Khorne	t o m c a t
2018-11-06 15:41:58	+aesthetik	LambdaComplex: no dont do that
2018-11-06 15:42:00	@Leliana	the JVM is a beautiful piece of engineering
2018-11-06 15:42:04	+aesthetik	nuuxe: what
2018-11-06 15:42:06	+LambdaComplex	aesthetik: why not? i'm a nice guy
2018-11-06 15:42:08	 *	LambdaComplex tips fedora
2018-11-06 15:42:15	@Leliana	bgiannan: name some
2018-11-06 15:42:17	+nuuxe	aesthetik: yes I mean that
2018-11-06 15:42:25	@eti	sup faglords
2018-11-06 15:42:27	@Leliana	aesthetik: get ready 4 this :')
2018-11-06 15:42:33	+aesthetik	>judging by the syntax
2018-11-06 15:42:37	+aesthetik	REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
2018-11-06 15:42:43	+nuuxe	lmao
2018-11-06 15:42:47	+LambdaComplex	Leliana: does it have map/filter/reduce
2018-11-06 15:42:50	@Leliana	I mean, have you seen lisp?
2018-11-06 15:42:52	@Leliana	LambdaComplex: yes
2018-11-06 15:42:54	+LambdaComplex	oh hey it does
2018-11-06 15:42:55	+LambdaComplex	huh
2018-11-06 15:42:56	workodera	code has to be pretty and nice to write and readable
2018-11-06 15:42:57	+aesthetik	lole
2018-11-06 15:42:57	+LambdaComplex	neat
2018-11-06 15:42:58	@enju	eti i my fav fag, howsitgoing
2018-11-06 15:42:58	+nuuxe	>programmer's convenience is not important
2018-11-06 15:42:58	+aesthetik	rekt
2018-11-06 15:42:59	+LambdaComplex	that's not useless though
2018-11-06 15:43:00	+nuuxe	nice
2018-11-06 15:43:03	bgiannan	Leliana, what now i have to remember them
2018-11-06 15:43:04	workodera	it's one of the most important things even imo
2018-11-06 15:43:09	@eti	yet another pointless nerd argument i see
2018-11-06 15:43:13	@Leliana	nuuxe: yet you spend ages configuring atext editor to pretend it's an IDE
2018-11-06 15:43:16	+LambdaComplex	hi eti you seem to be new to IRC?
2018-11-06 15:43:17	@eti	it's nice that i see everyone participate in this autism
2018-11-06 15:43:19	@enju	eti all day boi
2018-11-06 15:43:20	+aesthetik	nuuxe: as long s it's readable for the next guy
2018-11-06 15:43:22	+aesthetik	thats why java is nice
2018-11-06 15:43:31	+aesthetik	it urges you to write code in a verbose understandable way
2018-11-06 15:43:31	@Leliana	bgiannan: no you have to back up the shit you're talking :)
2018-11-06 15:43:35	bgiannan	java is READABLE ?!
2018-11-06 15:43:38	+aesthetik	which is v important for maintainability
2018-11-06 15:43:42	+nuuxe	wtf? lisp is nice
2018-11-06 15:43:43	+aesthetik	no it's write only sorry
2018-11-06 15:43:49	@eti	CSS IS READABLE PROVE ME WRONG
2018-11-06 15:43:51	workodera	there is such a thing as being too verbose
2018-11-06 15:43:55	+nuuxe	have you written any lisp be any chance?
2018-11-06 15:43:57	+aesthetik	eti: yes hello see minified css
2018-11-06 15:44:00	@enju	>mfw brainlets here cant into OOP
2018-11-06 15:44:07	@Leliana	Can't say I've ever thought Java was too verbose.
2018-11-06 15:44:08	workodera	>not writing minified css
2018-11-06 15:44:08	+LambdaComplex	Foobar foobar = new Foobar()
2018-11-06 15:44:12	+aesthetik	workodera: sure, but i findi tirare java does it
2018-11-06 15:44:31	@Leliana	LambdaComplex: yes hello welcome to static typing where you have to declare your types
2018-11-06 15:44:31	+aesthetik	LambdaComplex: now what if foobar is actually a class that extends foobar
2018-11-06 15:44:38	@Leliana	$class = new Class()
2018-11-06 15:44:39	+aesthetik	Foobar bar = new foobarThing();
2018-11-06 15:44:41	@eti	writing minified css is the chad thing
2018-11-06 15:44:42	@Leliana	oh look php has one word less
2018-11-06 15:44:43	+aesthetik	now you want to know
2018-11-06 15:44:57	@eti	sass virgins in suicide watch
2018-11-06 15:45:14	+LambdaComplex	Leliana: rust has static typing and you don't have to declare your types >:(
2018-11-06 15:45:17	@enju	oof I just made phpstorm shit itself AMA
2018-11-06 15:45:19	+aesthetik	do people honestly still use this chad joke thing
2018-11-06 15:45:27	@Leliana	no you just have to fight the borrow checker screaming at you every 10 seconds
2018-11-06 15:45:28	+aesthetik	enju: how are you today
2018-11-06 15:45:35	+LambdaComplex	Leliana: not if your code is correct!
2018-11-06 15:45:36	@Leliana	and work out the arcane rituals of syntax
2018-11-06 15:45:39	+aesthetik	Leliana: rust is a nazi
2018-11-06 15:45:45	@Leliana	>rust is great if your code is perfect
2018-11-06 15:45:48	@Leliana	might as well just use C then
2018-11-06 15:45:53	+aesthetik	there is only one true code way and if you dont follow it doesnt compile
2018-11-06 15:45:54	@enju	aesthetik p good actually, only have to assemble some ikea shit later and then I can finally move into my new place
2018-11-06 15:45:56	+aesthetik	sounds like python tbh
2018-11-06 15:46:02	+aesthetik	enju: yay!
2018-11-06 15:46:02	+LambdaComplex	but generics are comfy
2018-11-06 15:46:11	+aesthetik	ikea stuff can be a bitch to assemble sometimes
2018-11-06 15:46:11	@Leliana	guess what else has generics?
2018-11-06 15:46:11	@eti	aesthetik: no i don't use the chad meme but i wanted to sound like nuuxe 
2018-11-06 15:46:15	@Leliana	that's right, java
2018-11-06 15:46:21	@enju	guess what doesnt, thats right, golang
2018-11-06 15:46:22	+LambdaComplex	s i g h
2018-11-06 15:46:27	+Khorne	but java also has aids
2018-11-06 15:46:28	+aesthetik	i feel like im interpreting a holy script when building their furniture
2018-11-06 15:46:29	+Khorne	so theres that
2018-11-06 15:46:30	@enju	and still I found go the comfiest so far

2018-11-06 18:07:14	+bushidoboy	can't say I've ever thought of that before

2018-11-06 18:07:49	+nai	i thought you were doing some weird python shit

2018-11-06 18:08:23	+bushidoboy	cuz I'm stupid
2018-11-06 18:08:32	+nai	i mean
2018-11-06 18:08:35	+nai	not really pseudocode
2018-11-06 18:08:42	+nai	more like the assembly language of algorithms
2018-11-06 18:09:08	+nai	anyway whatever
2018-11-06 18:09:19	+bushidoboy	if you're doing assembly I'd say that's already enough work no need to throw like djikstras algo at you when learning x86 op codes
2018-11-06 18:09:35	+bushidoboy	but idk I may be talking out of my ass
2018-11-06 18:09:39	+bushidoboy	like usual
2018-11-06 18:09:56	+nai	no i didn't mean we're actually doing assembly
2018-11-06 18:09:59	+Khorne	arent you usually talking into your ass.
2018-11-06 18:10:04	+nai	more like building algorithms from the ground up

2018-11-06 20:55:09	@cosarara	Leliana: you can do whatever, I made a little complaint, dunno why you made such a big deal about it
2018-11-06 20:55:12	Ergo	ah its the other way around

2018-11-06 20:56:40	+Khorne	I mean surely you can just go
2018-11-06 20:56:42	+Khorne	Your boss wouldnt fire you and you wouldnt be without health insurance or w/e 
2018-11-06 20:57:00	+bushidoboy	as far as I'm aware your boss technically cant stop you
2018-11-06 20:57:01	+Khorne	free market will make it possible for you to immediately be rehired
2018-11-06 20:57:04	+Khorne	bushidoboy, no
2018-11-06 20:57:12	+bushidoboy	much in the same way you can't be fired for jury duty
2018-11-06 20:57:14	+Khorne	Technically not
2018-11-06 20:57:15	@Leliana	Khorne: it's actually a real problem, and yes, companies to refuse to let people go vote with the implicit thread of punishment
2018-11-06 20:57:22	+Khorne	Leliana, I know
2018-11-06 20:57:28	+Khorne	What is sarcasm?
2018-11-06 20:57:39	@Leliana	baby don't hurt me
2018-11-06 20:57:42	+bushidoboy	that being said most companies are quite for encouraging people to vote this time
2018-11-06 20:57:43	+Khorne	:')
2018-11-06 20:57:52	+Khorne	bushidoboy, prolly pleb liberal companies

2018-11-06 20:57:54	+Khorne	wew
2018-11-06 20:58:02	+Khorne	muh liburuls
2018-11-06 20:58:41	+bushidoboy	I'm pretty centrist myself but I'm a little concerned over how everyone's going and just voting strict democrat without really caring who they're voting for or what they stand for
2018-11-06 20:58:54	+bushidoboy	again, don't like the current administration, but I think they might be overcompensating

2018-11-06 20:58:57	Ergo	i mean, you dont reallly have another choice in the US do you 
2018-11-06 20:59:00	Ergo	outside of abstaining 
2018-11-06 20:59:03	@Leliana	honestly democracy in the US is a joke
2018-11-06 20:59:06	+Khorne	but do you like babies being shot at the border bushidoboy 
2018-11-06 20:59:08	@Leliana	free country my ass

2018-11-06 20:59:15	+Khorne	Not as much of as joke as Russia
2018-11-06 20:59:17	+bushidoboy	I agree it's a mess
2018-11-06 20:59:19	+Khorne	But pretty funny still
2018-11-06 20:59:20	Ergo	then again in NL we have a bezillion party system 
2018-11-06 20:59:21	@Leliana	Khorne: yet
2018-11-06 20:59:24	+Khorne	Ye
2018-11-06 20:59:26	@cosarara	their separation of powers is not bad
2018-11-06 20:59:27	Ergo	im not sure if thats the right way to go either 
2018-11-06 20:59:28	@Leliana	wait till daddy putin gets elbow deep into trump
2018-11-06 20:59:30	+bushidoboy	Right now it's less of a mess and more of a joke
2018-11-06 20:59:38	+Khorne	Ergo, actually I would prefer that for once in Germany
2018-11-06 20:59:43	Ergo	i mean, i really like it 
2018-11-06 20:59:47	+Khorne	Instead of coalitions and their plans
2018-11-06 20:59:53	Ergo	but they could tone it down a little 
2018-11-06 20:59:57	@Leliana	cosarara: lol, seperation of powers
2018-11-06 21:00:03	+Khorne	Vote on issue by issue after your *conscience*
2018-11-06 21:00:05	+Khorne	Or at least party guidelines/programs
2018-11-06 21:00:07	@Leliana	the FCC is supposed to be seperate from government
2018-11-06 21:00:10	@Leliana	look how that turned out
2018-11-06 21:00:19	Ergo	I voted on a center-left part but they betrayed me 
2018-11-06 21:00:22	Ergo	definitly voting left next time 
2018-11-06 21:00:29	@Leliana	seperation means fuck all when there's bribes- sorry, lobbying going on
2018-11-06 21:00:31	+Khorne	Wer hat uns verraten? Sozialdemokraten.
2018-11-06 21:00:58	+Khorne	Granted, our socialidemocrats would probably be shot as commie traitors in the US
2018-11-06 21:01:45	Ergo	lol 
2018-11-06 21:01:49	Ergo	you know of groenlinks? 
2018-11-06 21:01:53	Ergo	thats the party im voting next time 
2018-11-06 21:02:12	@Leliana	I'm voting for myself in our next general election
2018-11-06 21:02:16	@Leliana	leliana 4 prime minister
2018-11-06 21:02:39	@Leliana	I'll build a wall, and france can pay for it.
2018-11-06 21:02:40	+Khorne	Ergo, no I'm not dutch :')
2018-11-06 21:02:50	Ergo	like the bad thing about the system in the netherlands is that a small party with like 11 seats out of 150 can end up in the gov because it can help another party get a majority 
2018-11-06 21:03:02	Ergo	but that party is basically irrelevant as fuck otherwise 
2018-11-06 21:03:15	Ergo	5 seats even 
2018-11-06 21:03:16	+Khorne	Ergo, see thats the first problem I have with the building of coalitions per term
2018-11-06 21:03:34	Ergo	party i voted for has 19, but the party i should have voted for are 14 
2018-11-06 21:03:35	+Khorne	I'd much rather these 11 seats could shake a vote independently of a predetermined coalition contract
2018-11-06 21:04:02	+Khorne	Also we have a miniumum a party has to gather in the general election to get seats (outside of direct mandates)
2018-11-06 21:04:04	+Khorne	5%
2018-11-06 21:04:07	Ergo	another problem is that we have way too many flavours of left
2018-11-06 21:04:17	+Khorne	Thats a general leftist problem lol
2018-11-06 21:04:19	Ergo	where there is only 1/2 big right wing parties 
2018-11-06 21:04:27	Ergo	so its way easier for them to get into the gov 
2018-11-06 21:04:28	@Leliana	Ergo: that's only because people apply arbitrary labels to every little thing
2018-11-06 21:04:49	@Leliana	it's a spectrum fam
2018-11-06 21:04:52	Ergo	like if you would count the left wing parties combined votes they far overcome the right wing 
2018-11-06 21:04:59	Ergo	but the right wing votes are more consolidated
2018-11-06 21:05:01	Ergo	if that is the right word 
2018-11-06 21:05:08	+nuuxe	yay I made emacs support ligatures without breaking indentation https://0x0.st/sIku.png
2018-11-06 21:05:23	@Leliana	nuuxe: I made IDE do that
2018-11-06 21:05:28	@Leliana	IDEA*
2018-11-06 21:05:36	@Leliana	I opened the settings and clicked "font ligatures"
2018-11-06 21:05:39	@Leliana	just werx
2018-11-06 21:05:45	+nuuxe	good for you
2018-11-06 21:05:49	+Khorne	Ergo, which wouldnt matter if everyone voted according to what they think :P
2018-11-06 21:05:52	@Leliana	:')
2018-11-06 21:05:55	@Leliana	emacs fags btfo
2018-11-06 21:06:32	@Leliana	seriously though, how do people call that beautiful syntax
2018-11-06 21:07:00	@Leliana	and lisp too
2018-11-06 21:07:06	@Leliana	I see nothing "beautiful" about lisp
2018-11-06 21:07:08	Ergo	Khorne: ye true but still 
2018-11-06 21:07:09	+Khorne	ligatures are actually harmful
2018-11-06 21:07:30	Ergo	do i go and spend the time to configure lemonbar hmmmmm
2018-11-06 21:07:32	@Leliana	Khorne: have you seen the ones for !=
2018-11-06 21:07:35	@Leliana	and == vs ===
2018-11-06 21:07:37	Ergo	atleast i found a good resource/guide for it 
2018-11-06 21:07:51	+Khorne	Leliana, oh im quoting nuuxe from half a year ago when I enabled ligatures :')
2018-11-06 21:07:56	@Leliana	kek
2018-11-06 21:08:14	+Khorne	at least I think it was him...someone here at least
2018-11-06 21:08:15	@Leliana	but yeah, I find ligatures make the code less readable at a glance
2018-11-06 21:08:22	@Leliana	especially for shit like ==
2018-11-06 21:08:32	+Khorne	you get used to it
2018-11-06 21:08:51	+Khorne	but ye == vs === is annoying
2018-11-06 21:08:55	+Khorne	but -> is purdy
2018-11-06 21:09:18	+Khorne	and != too actually
2018-11-06 21:09:37	+nuuxe	Khorne: I never said anything bad about ligatures. I wanted to enable them for emacs half a year ago tho but it wasn't successful back then
2018-11-06 21:09:46	+nai	why is python pip so shit
2018-11-06 21:09:48	+Khorne	Then it was someone else here
2018-11-06 21:09:54	+Khorne	nai, is it...or are you
2018-11-06 21:09:55	@Leliana	nai: because you're using it wrong
2018-11-06 21:10:14	+Khorne	nai, just use -U with install
2018-11-06 21:10:20	+nai	why doesn't it have dependency removal
2018-11-06 21:10:23	+nai	i just don't get it
2018-11-06 21:10:49	+Khorne	what
2018-11-06 21:10:50	+nai	now i'm left with a bunch of shit in my ~/.local/{bin,lib}
2018-11-06 21:11:01	+nai	that was pulled by something i removed
2018-11-06 21:11:02	+Khorne	dont install there then
2018-11-06 21:11:08	+nuuxe	just delete .local/shit lmao
2018-11-06 21:11:10	+nai	and it doesn't detect that they're unneeded dependencies
2018-11-06 21:11:20	+nai	isn't that the fucking base of dep management
2018-11-06 21:11:55	Ergo	does anyone know if vim_instant_markdown works with neovim 
2018-11-06 21:12:00	+Khorne	works
2018-11-06 21:12:08	+nuuxe	nai: https://pypi.org/project/pip-autoremove/

2018-11-06 21:12:19	Ergo	also any reason to use neovim over regular vim with plugins 
2018-11-06 21:12:22	+nai	nuuxe: yeah, i saw that.
2018-11-06 21:12:22	Ergo	never tried the latter 
2018-11-06 21:12:28	+nai	still, an EXTERNAL tool? really?
2018-11-06 21:12:29	Ergo	cause people told me neovim is better lol 
2018-11-06 21:12:39	+nuuxe	better than nothing
2018-11-06 21:12:43	+Khorne	Ergo, doesnt matter really
2018-11-06 21:12:59	+Khorne	nai, youre supposed to use it in conjunction with venvs in the first place
2018-11-06 21:13:13	+nuuxe	^this tbh

2018-11-06 21:13:45	+Khorne	then kys
2018-11-06 21:13:52	+nai	i don't want to source a venv every time i need to use something in a python project
2018-11-06 21:13:54	+nai	this sucks
2018-11-06 21:13:57	+Khorne	"Why does it suck when I use it wrong"
2018-11-06 21:14:05	+nai	why not just do dependency management like literally every other package manager in the world
2018-11-06 21:14:13	+Khorne	prs welcome
2018-11-06 21:14:20	@Leliana	nai: or just use poetry
2018-11-06 21:14:26	+Khorne	why not use literally any other language ever
2018-11-06 21:14:39	+nai	because python is good
2018-11-06 21:14:40	@Leliana	also you do know you can just invoke python from venv/bin/, right?
2018-11-06 21:14:44	@Leliana	you don't have to source anything
2018-11-06 21:14:53	+Khorne	Leliana, I thought we established he doesnt know shit
2018-11-06 21:14:56	+nai	Leliana: seems nice, is it retro compatible with pip packages?
2018-11-06 21:15:01	@Leliana	fuck knows
2018-11-06 21:15:04	+nai	i know that
2018-11-06 21:15:07	+nai	it's just lame

2018-11-06 21:15:52	+bushidoboy	Can python stop trying to reimplement pip every 10 minutes
2018-11-06 21:16:03	+Khorne	"python"
2018-11-06 21:16:19	+Khorne	also alternatives are good
2018-11-06 21:16:39	+bushidoboy	pipenv is fine with me, and at least it's developed by Reitz who is well known and somewhat trusted for his work on requests
2018-11-06 21:16:53	+bushidoboy	even though he's a bit of a loon and hails from Winchester, Virigina
2018-11-06 21:16:53	@Leliana	bushidoboy: where did you get the idea poetry has anything to do with python developers?
2018-11-06 21:16:56	+nuuxe	anyone here uses ruby?
2018-11-06 21:17:00	@Leliana	it's a totally seperate project
2018-11-06 21:17:00	--	m712 is now known as Qanon
2018-11-06 21:17:18	+bushidoboy	Sorry, I see where you might have misunderstood
2018-11-06 21:17:23	--	Qanon is now known as Qt
2018-11-06 21:17:32	+bushidoboy	I should have said "Can the python community stop trying to reimplement pip every 10 minutes"
2018-11-06 21:17:38	+bushidoboy	that's my bad
2018-11-06 21:17:41	@Leliana	no
2018-11-06 21:17:45	+Khorne	doesnt change anything
2018-11-06 21:17:48	@Leliana	because like Khorne said, alternatives are always good
2018-11-06 21:17:49	+Khorne	why does it matter
2018-11-06 21:17:52	@Leliana	and they're not reinventing pip
2018-11-06 21:17:57	@Leliana	they're making an alternative
2018-11-06 21:18:01	+Khorne	can the js community stop shitting out a dialect every 30 seconds?
2018-11-06 21:18:04	@Leliana	the existence of poetry does not stop you using pip
2018-11-06 21:18:13	+Khorne	can the c community stop shitting out a dialect every 5 years?
2018-11-06 21:18:20	+bushidoboy	is it a frontend for pip or just another package manager?
2018-11-06 21:18:26	@Leliana	..
2018-11-06 21:18:30	@Leliana	just open the fucking page
2018-11-06 21:18:36	+bushidoboy	I'm looking at it now
2018-11-06 21:19:12	+Khorne	Cnosidering it publishes to pypi
2018-11-06 21:20:11	+bushidoboy	just skimming the docs, it looks like every other option: fine for what it is
2018-11-06 21:21:43	+bushidoboy	python packaging/deps is a nightmare, so in my mind I think it would be ideal if they pooled their efforts into a single project. I get that's unrealistic and that people will inevitably have different ideas, but I think it's just unneccessary
2018-11-06 21:22:07	+bushidoboy	as Khorne said, alternatives are good, and if people wanna use it and it works, cool
2018-11-06 21:22:55	+Khorne	bushidoboy, but thats true for most languages which ship modules or packages
2018-11-06 21:23:53	@eti	i want a cute hobo gf
2018-11-06 21:23:55	+Khorne	Npm is a fucking disaster
2018-11-06 21:24:06	+Khorne	Gems are a fucking disaster
2018-11-06 21:24:08	+bushidoboy	Agreed, but I think some langs get pretty close. I think rust has done pretty well so far
2018-11-06 21:24:10	@Leliana	Khorne: do you know of any EU law requiring multiplayer traffic in games be encrypted? https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/9un4l0/people_already_have_hacks/e96hvbi/

2018-11-06 21:25:15	+bushidoboy	cargo for rust has been nice, at least in my experience
2018-11-06 21:25:42	+Khorne	bushidoboy: yeah but that is implicitly project based
2018-11-06 21:25:47	@Leliana	yeah but nobody likes rust

2018-11-06 21:26:10	@Leliana	same thing
2018-11-06 21:26:13	+bushidoboy	:(
2018-11-06 21:26:39	+Khorne	Leliana: and no unless you really twist gdpr I guess
2018-11-06 21:26:52	+Khorne	Even then..meh
2018-11-06 21:26:57	@Leliana	i mean it's not like the server's /storing/ game traffic
2018-11-06 21:27:33	@Leliana	I doubt it's even sending personal info
2018-11-06 21:28:10	+Khorne	Well it might
2018-11-06 21:28:31	+Khorne	At least information that leads to the identification of a user
2018-11-06 21:29:18	@Leliana	I doubt that honestly
2018-11-06 21:29:24	+Khorne	User ids
2018-11-06 21:29:32	@Leliana	or, yno
2018-11-06 21:29:34	@Leliana	session tokens
2018-11-06 21:29:34	+Khorne	Ip addresses
2018-11-06 21:29:45	+Khorne	'might'
2018-11-06 21:29:51	@Leliana	Khorne: in a p2p situation, sure
2018-11-06 21:30:00	+Khorne	Sure
2018-11-06 21:30:03	+Khorne	But idk
2018-11-06 21:30:11	+bushidoboy	I would imagine udp would be preffered for multiplayer just for transmission speed
2018-11-06 21:30:20	@Leliana	>imagine
2018-11-06 21:30:22	+Khorne	I don't care enough about Fallout to bother with it workings
2018-11-06 21:30:27	@Leliana	I thought UDP for games was common knowledge?
2018-11-06 21:31:10	+bushidoboy	Right, but that comment you're replying to seems like he's upset they're not encrypting the traffic 
2018-11-06 21:31:43	+bushidoboy	I'm with you on this, I can see tcp being used for login verification and stuff; that's fine
2018-11-06 21:31:48	@Leliana	no he's trying to say they are, even though nothing in his screenshots indicates game traffic is encrypted, just some https traffic
2018-11-06 21:32:07	+bushidoboy	ahhhh gotcha
2018-11-06 21:32:22	+Khorne	Leliana, the gdpr guidelines or policies are essentially: Dont leak data or data fragments that when assembled can lead to identification of users
2018-11-06 21:33:00	@Leliana	> Summary edit: While in game and running around the game uses DTLS, UDP (sometimes), and DIS packets during gameplay. DTLS is encrypted UDP, UDP is an unencrypted network protocol, DIS appears to be VoIP. I could not see any other players IP address.
2018-11-06 21:33:00	+Khorne	Which is...as vague as it can be really
2018-11-06 21:33:19	@Leliana	seems to be implying the lack of being able to see IP addresses is because it's encrypted
2018-11-06 21:33:21	@Leliana	or
2018-11-06 21:33:29	@Leliana	just maybe, it's because that information is never sent
2018-11-06 21:33:32	@Leliana	because it's not p2p
2018-11-06 21:33:34	@Leliana	not is VOIP
2018-11-06 21:33:38	@Leliana	s/t/r/
2018-11-06 21:33:38	+cappuccino	Leliana meant to say: nor is VOIP
2018-11-06 21:34:14	@Leliana	I'm not even sure how you could encrypt IP addresses
2018-11-06 21:34:18	+bushidoboy	I can't see the imgur link (work firewall) but how is he measuring
2018-11-06 21:34:24	@Leliana	how tf do you connect in a p2p situation if you don't know the address
2018-11-06 21:34:35	+Khorne	you cant
2018-11-06 21:34:36	@Leliana	bushidoboy: wireshark
2018-11-06 21:34:57	+Khorne	Leliana, theres the exempt "for technical reasons"
2018-11-06 21:35:21	+Khorne	As in, its literally impossible for a server owner to not know what ip a connection is coming from etc
2018-11-06 21:35:42	@Leliana	yeah that's what I'm saying
2018-11-06 21:36:20	@Leliana	so him thinking a lack of IP addresses from other players is because it's encrypted
2018-11-06 21:36:25	+Khorne	Leliana, then again if you remember what skype did in the early years, run other users traffic through your client with nodes/supernodes
2018-11-06 21:36:31	@Leliana	when it's because it's not fucking p2p so why would the server ever send that to other players
2018-11-06 21:37:23	@Leliana	it's like saying an http connection must be encrypted because you can't see the IP of another user on the site
2018-11-06 21:38:02	+bushidoboy	yeah I can't see how this would be feasibly p2p. more likely communication is to their servers only

2018-11-06 23:40:54	zzzeyez	btw on macos if you want to make bars you have to do it with css3
2018-11-06 23:40:57	 *	nai sheds a tear

2018-11-06 23:41:57	@eti	i'm never leaving you <3
2018-11-06 23:42:03	zzzeyez	it's not a hobby, it's a personality trait
2018-11-06 23:42:03	+nai	#rice-but-eti-is-gone or something
2018-11-06 23:42:14	@eti	zzzeyez: that's rad tbh, i love css
2018-11-06 23:42:15	Ergo	eti: i love that bar on ur latest post 
2018-11-06 23:42:16	@eti	i'll use pecan
2018-11-06 23:42:22	@eti	or even try to make my own ;)
2018-11-06 23:42:29	+nai	-well-,-not-gone-but-you-know-what-i-mean-he-has-stopped-ricing-kinda
2018-11-06 23:42:36	zzzeyez	it's pretty easy
2018-11-06 23:42:40	@eti	can you run lemonbar with xquartz or whatever it's called?
2018-11-06 23:42:46	Ergo	is that thing on the right clickable? 
2018-11-06 23:42:48	zzzeyez	i think so yes
2018-11-06 23:42:56	Ergo	eti: just rice macOS ez 
2018-11-06 23:42:58	@eti	nai: nah fam, no need for anything, people forget about ricers quickly
2018-11-06 23:43:09	@eti	Ergo: what thing on the right
2018-11-06 23:43:14	Ergo	the orange bit 
2018-11-06 23:43:15	Ergo	in the bar 
2018-11-06 23:43:17	Ergo	next to the time 
2018-11-06 23:43:21	@eti	yeah
2018-11-06 23:43:24	@eti	toggles my irc window
2018-11-06 23:43:27	@eti	it's quite useful
2018-11-06 23:43:30	+nai	> people say i have declined; but it doesn't matter. i'm happy.
2018-11-06 23:43:33	Ergo	thats pretty neat 
2018-11-06 23:43:34	+nai	awwww
2018-11-06 23:43:43	+nai	you haven't declined shit
2018-11-06 23:43:57	@eti	zzzeyez: then i'll just keep my current bar and convert it for macos i guess 
2018-11-06 23:43:59	+nai	eti: do you think you could put a history of your rice on that page? like add more of the older ones
2018-11-06 23:44:08	@eti	i posted a zip a few days ago
2018-11-06 23:44:13	@eti	with all of my desktops in it
2018-11-06 23:44:13	Ergo	gimme gimme 
2018-11-06 23:44:23	@eti	give me a sec, i need to find that link
2018-11-06 23:44:35	zzzeyez	i would much rather use lemonbar
2018-11-06 23:45:07	Ergo	>not having a bar because i dont like polybar but am to big dum dum for lemonbar 
2018-11-06 23:45:15	@eti	here https://x.eti.tf/gUCxk.zip
2018-11-06 23:45:32	@eti	Ergo: just learn scripting, if i did it then anyone else can
2018-11-06 23:45:40	@eti	zzzeyez: why don't you use lemonbar then?
2018-11-06 23:45:44	Ergo	yee i might start tonight 
2018-11-06 23:45:44	zzzeyez	lemonbar seems way easier than polybar
2018-11-06 23:45:50	+Khorne	v rude eti
2018-11-06 23:45:56	zzzeyez	i never used polybar
2018-11-06 23:46:04	@eti	Khorne: where have i been rude
2018-11-06 23:46:06	Ergo	polybar is easy because it has modules and stuff, but pretty often lemonbars look so much better 
2018-11-06 23:46:15	+Khorne	<@eti> or Khorne
2018-11-06 23:46:15	@eti	zzzeyez: no, polybar is just plugins, lemonbar is from scratch
2018-11-06 23:46:28	zzzeyez	oh damn
2018-11-06 23:46:29	@eti	but you learn way more with lemon imo
2018-11-06 23:46:38	+Khorne	You can make polybar look just like lemon
2018-11-06 23:46:46	Ergo	would lemonbar be a good way to start learning bout scripting? 
2018-11-06 23:46:48	+aesthetik	bye nerds
2018-11-06 23:46:50	+aesthetik	gnight
2018-11-06 23:46:53	Ergo	night aesthetik 
2018-11-06 23:46:54	+Khorne	Ergo: prolly
2018-11-06 23:47:02	@eti	Khorne: well i meant that you could keep the sjws back, that's a good thing lol
2018-11-06 23:47:06	@eti	aesthetik: nini
2018-11-06 23:47:06	+Khorne	Do yourself a favor don't do it in bash
2018-11-06 23:47:14	@eti	Ergo: yes
2018-11-06 23:47:17	@eti	do it in fish
2018-11-06 23:47:20	Ergo	i was about to switch to fish actually 
2018-11-06 23:47:20	zzzeyez	yeah i miss lemonbar, i didn't know you could run gui stuff through xquartz until i saw ouwuo or w/e do it
2018-11-06 23:47:20	@eti	jk, bash is fine
2018-11-06 23:47:29	Ergo	i used fish on void, it was quite nice 
2018-11-06 23:47:29	@eti	NO DON'T DO LEMONBAR IN FISH
2018-11-06 23:47:29	+nai	Ergo: if you want a good(?) start, read the lemonbar examples in the bspwm repo
2018-11-06 23:47:32	+Khorne	Bash is big suck
2018-11-06 23:47:32	@eti	it's a pain
2018-11-06 23:47:34	@eti	trust me
2018-11-06 23:47:43	@eti	everything but my bar scripts are in fish
2018-11-06 23:47:46	+Khorne	Write something nice in a nice language
2018-11-06 23:47:59	Ergo	i was planning on using this http://blog.z3bra.org/2014/04/meeting-at-the-bar.html
2018-11-06 23:47:59	+cappuccino	[ blog.z3bra.org ] z3bra.org - monochromatic blog (text/html)
2018-11-06 23:48:04	Ergo	as a resource
2018-11-06 23:48:08	Ergo	i will also look at those nai 
2018-11-06 23:48:12	+nai	> z3bra.org
2018-11-06 23:48:15	+nai	yeah that's probably fine
2018-11-06 23:48:15	@eti	zzzeyez: lemme know if you manage to use it thru xquartz, i'm curious !
2018-11-06 23:48:17	zzzeyez	i have never written anything in fish except fish functions
2018-11-06 23:48:25	Ergo	its a pretty good resource tho 
2018-11-06 23:48:28	zzzeyez	i'm gonna try
2018-11-06 23:48:44	@eti	Ergo: it's good resource but it's outdated, just look at my wbr.sh in dots/scripts/wbr.sh instead
2018-11-06 23:48:50	@eti	and try and understand how it works
2018-11-06 23:49:02	@eti	if you get stuck, shoot a message here and nai will answer
2018-11-06 23:49:05	+Khorne	This is horseshit Ergo
2018-11-06 23:49:07	+nuuxe	fish???
2018-11-06 23:49:09	+Khorne	TBH
2018-11-06 23:49:14	Ergo	Khorne: you mean that guide? 
2018-11-06 23:49:15	+nai	or ask #bash on freenode
2018-11-06 23:49:15	@eti	and he'll also bully me for using shitty code
2018-11-06 23:49:19	+nai	i will probably answer there too
2018-11-06 23:49:23	@eti	but that's just nai for you
2018-11-06 23:49:26	+Khorne	Ergo: everything about it
2018-11-06 23:49:30	+nai	eti: fish xD
2018-11-06 23:49:40	 *	nai bullies eti on the fish
2018-11-06 23:49:43	+Khorne	Everything about feeding info to bars like that is shit
2018-11-06 23:49:43	Ergo	how soo 
2018-11-06 23:49:46	@Leliana	never ask nai for bash advice
2018-11-06 23:49:59	@Leliana	unless you want your whole home directory expose to the internet
2018-11-06 23:50:06	+nai	s\bash/linux user security/
2018-11-06 23:50:06	 *	nuuxe slaps eti around with a large fish
2018-11-06 23:50:07	Ergo	oh, i wouldnt know about that Khorne 
2018-11-06 23:50:11	+Khorne	Ergo: because it updates everything every second even if 90% of it don't need an update
2018-11-06 23:50:19	Ergo	lol that does seem kinda bad ye 
2018-11-06 23:50:33	@Leliana	just use awesomewm tbh
2018-11-06 23:50:33	Ergo	resources on lemonbar are quite scarce tho 
2018-11-06 23:50:38	@Leliana	this exact shit doesn't happen
2018-11-06 23:50:44	Ergo	I dont think im leaving 2bwm anytime soon 
2018-11-06 23:50:45	@Leliana	because wibar is, would you believe it, not shit
2018-11-06 23:50:53	+nuuxe	.np
2018-11-06 23:50:54	+cappuccino	nuuxe (azahi) is now playing ????? by ???
2018-11-06 23:50:55	+Khorne	Or write independently executed modules properly
2018-11-06 23:51:01	+nai	Khorne: uh, not necessarily?
2018-11-06 23:51:05	+Khorne	At which point why would you bother with bash
2018-11-06 23:51:15	+Khorne	nai: the way that guide is written it does
2018-11-06 23:51:16	+nai	most of the things in my bar are polling
2018-11-06 23:51:21	+nai	oh ok maybe
2018-11-06 23:51:23	@Leliana	Khorne: kinda makes me laugh when people think these bars are minimal
2018-11-06 23:51:37	@Leliana	calling shell scripts every second in a bloated as fuck shell to begin with is minimal?
2018-11-06 23:51:39	@Leliana	suuuuure
2018-11-06 23:51:45	+nai	huh
2018-11-06 23:51:48	+nai	you call the script once
2018-11-06 23:51:50	+nai	dummy
2018-11-06 23:51:56	+Khorne	nai: as I continued to explain you want to use polling (and can in bash) but it's fuck ass annoying
2018-11-06 23:51:58	@Leliana	and what does that script to?
2018-11-06 23:52:03	@Leliana	that's right, calls other scripts and functions
2018-11-06 23:52:13	zzzeyez	here are separate lemonbars for volume, battery, date, wifi, song, workspace, time Ergo .  you can easily see how to pull all those values https://github.com/zzzeyez/dotfiles_linux/tree/master/bin
2018-11-06 23:52:13	+cappuccino	[ github.com ] dotfiles_linux/bin at master ? zzzeyez/dotfiles_linux ? GitHub (text/html)
2018-11-06 23:52:15	+Khorne	At least to me
2018-11-06 23:52:24	+nai	mostly binaries and functions
2018-11-06 23:52:30	@Leliana	>multiple bars to emulate one bar without shitty updating
2018-11-06 23:52:32	@Leliana	REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
2018-11-06 23:52:33	+nai	binaries which you should call anyway if you need the info
2018-11-06 23:52:41	+nai	and functions don't cost much once the shell is launched
2018-11-06 23:52:49	@Leliana	nai: I don't need to call anything to do that :)
2018-11-06 23:52:52	+Khorne	I like how your aur.sh does not actually check the aur
2018-11-06 23:52:54	@Leliana	it's all done natively in lua
2018-11-06 23:52:58	+nai	unless you're doing it in an actual programming language
2018-11-06 23:53:04	+nai	in which case, yeah, sure, you're a good person
2018-11-06 23:53:07	+Khorne	nai: that's what I said
2018-11-06 23:53:09	+nai	do you want a cookie?
2018-11-06 23:53:13	@Leliana	not just lua either, luajit
2018-11-06 23:53:16	@Leliana	nai: if it's french, no
2018-11-06 23:53:25	+nai	because i have this cookie right there and i don't know what to do with it
2018-11-06 23:53:26	Ergo	hmmm do i try to write a script for screenshot taking and uploading to something first 
2018-11-06 23:53:31	 *	nai stuffs it into Leliana's mouth
2018-11-06 23:53:33	Ergo	or lemonbar 
2018-11-06 23:53:37	@Leliana	Ergo: there are no end of screenshot scripts
2018-11-06 23:53:43	@Leliana	you literally do not need to make your own
2018-11-06 23:53:50	Ergo	i asked earlier, no one gave me one :( 
2018-11-06 23:53:51	zzzeyez	srsly
2018-11-06 23:53:51	+nai	i mean
2018-11-06 23:53:55	+nai	if you want to learn scripting
2018-11-06 23:53:58	+nai	absolutely do make your own shit
2018-11-06 23:54:03	Ergo	and learning scripting does seem useful 
2018-11-06 23:54:04	@Leliana	Ergo: https://rizonrice.github.io/resources#sharing-it
2018-11-06 23:54:04	+cappuccino	[ rizonrice.github.io ] #rice - list o' resources (text/html)
2018-11-06 23:54:08	+nuuxe	literally everyone has their own screenshot uploading script these days
2018-11-06 23:54:10	+nai	even if 13571038 alternatives exist
2018-11-06 23:54:38	zzzeyez	yeah mine is just a roughly edited version of the 0x0.st script for macos
2018-11-06 23:54:51	@Leliana	I mean uploading a file can be as simple as `echo Hello world. | curl -F 'f:1=<-' ix.io`
2018-11-06 23:54:56	@Leliana	don't even need a script as such
2018-11-06 23:55:16	Ergo	i dont even know what curl does so there is much to learn lol 
2018-11-06 23:55:46	+nai	Leliana: or.. it can be more complex
2018-11-06 23:56:11	+Khorne	Complexity is bad
2018-11-06 23:56:26	+Khorne	Have you not learned anything from the systemd fiasco
2018-11-06 23:56:38	+nai	wew
2018-11-06 23:56:38	+cappuccino	w e w l a d
2018-11-06 23:56:50	+nai	cappuccino: you got it buddy
2018-11-06 23:56:51	+cappuccino	suki: my name zach
2018-11-06 23:56:56	+Khorne	Lol
2018-11-06 23:57:02	+nai	god, haven't seen suits in a long time btw
2018-11-06 23:57:05	+nai	or oda
2018-11-06 23:57:18	+Khorne	Yea unfortunate
2018-11-06 23:57:28	Ergo	i meann, you just grab the 0x0 script right 
2018-11-06 23:57:39	Ergo	then get a combination of slop and maim to throw something in there 
2018-11-06 23:58:09	@Leliana	or just use pste.pw which has it's own script :3
2018-11-06 23:58:18	+nai	> it's
2018-11-06 23:58:20	+nai	come on
2018-11-06 23:58:33	@Leliana	nai: fuck you, it's how I do it and you can't stop me
2018-11-06 23:58:40	Ergo	i really dont mind what service i use tbh 
2018-11-06 23:58:54	zzzeyez	just edit the 0x0 one yeah
2018-11-06 23:58:55	+nai	the only good service is your own service

2018-11-06 23:59:13	Ergo	then i would have to get hosting first 
2018-11-06 23:59:21	Ergo	and a domain name 
2018-11-07 00:00:27	@eti	MY NAME ZACH
2018-11-07 00:00:33	@eti	i want cappy to say my name jeff
2018-11-07 00:00:39	@eti	cappuccino: say it
2018-11-07 00:00:40	+cappuccino	Is it because it breaks javascript on chrome and safari
2018-11-07 00:01:04	Ergo	looking at it, isnt all you have to do after screenshotting a image is putting the path of the image in a variable and then modify the 0x0 script to use that variable 
2018-11-07 00:01:14	Ergo	that was more text then i thought it would be 
2018-11-07 00:01:49	+nai	Ergo: you can get hosting and a dn pretty quickly and for cheap
2018-11-07 00:01:59	Ergo	on digitalocean? 
2018-11-07 00:02:15	Ergo	thats waht leliana reccomended me

2018-11-07 00:02:37	@Leliana	1GB ram for $5/month
2018-11-07 00:02:45	@Leliana	and you only pay a few $ for a domain once a year
2018-11-07 00:03:11	+nai	there's scaleway and vultr too
2018-11-07 00:03:24	Ergo	i just want the easiest one tbh 
2018-11-07 00:03:45	Ergo	like all i need it for is to host a website for the computer service thing i wanna setup 
2018-11-07 00:03:49	Ergo	and personal stuff 
2018-11-07 00:04:16	zzzeyez	Ergo: save your screenshot as a specific file and call the upload tool to upload that specific file.  for example /tmp/screenshot.png
2018-11-07 00:04:26	Ergo	yee thats what i was thinking 
2018-11-07 00:05:34	zzzeyez	i mean rly you could just set a keybind to like 'scrot /tmp/screen.png && upload.sh'
2018-11-07 00:05:40	@cosarara	OVH's VPS SSD 1 is 2GB RAM, 20GB SSD, $3.35/mo

2018-11-07 00:08:31	Ergo	shouldnt be too hard tho 
2018-11-07 00:10:02	+nai	copy an *image* to your clipboard?
2018-11-07 00:10:12	Ergo	combining both i mean 
2018-11-07 00:10:13	+nai	or do you mean an url or a path
2018-11-07 00:11:30	Ergo	the url
2018-11-07 00:11:40	Ergo	but i will have to get it to upload first
2018-11-07 00:11:42	Ergo	but should be fine 
2018-11-07 00:11:58	+nai	most services return an url *after* they are done uploading
2018-11-07 00:13:05	zzzeyez	0x0.st might even allow you to auto send it to yr clipboard with a flag like -p or something

2018-11-07 00:23:42	+nai	the answer doesn't address the question at all
2018-11-07 00:23:48	+nai	he explains how to upload to 0x0.st
2018-11-07 00:23:59	Ergo	ahhh sure 
2018-11-07 00:24:15	+nai	but really it's not complicated: upload the file to some dir your host using rsync or scp
2018-11-07 00:24:24	+nai	and make sure that dir's content is served over http somehow
2018-11-07 00:24:28	zzzeyez	just look at his script and ignore the instructions
2018-11-07 00:24:38	+nai	his script uses curl
2018-11-07 00:24:44	Ergo	oh right, if it wasnt obvious yet i can not write a single line of code 
2018-11-07 00:24:53	Ergo	or i can html/css/php but that was 3 years ago 
2018-11-07 00:25:04	+nai	you're probably not gonna be using curl on your personal website unless you really want to implement a whole uploading service with a backend and shit
2018-11-07 00:25:21	zzzeyez	i mean you could just use his script and install the dependencies
2018-11-07 00:25:33	Ergo	i honestly just want it to post the image to somewhere lol
2018-11-07 00:25:40	+Khorne	Just don't do what nai did

2018-11-07 00:26:00	+nai	i thought the issue was unrelated to that thing lmao

2018-11-07 10:35:09	zyeri	it's probably not good, but you can still do it

2018-11-07 10:36:11	@eti	zyeri: there's no way i can call someone a web designer if he doesn't know the most basic principles of ui/ux

2018-11-07 10:36:39	@eti	so no, you can't web design (as in be good at it) if you don't know jack shit about design

2018-11-07 10:37:33	zyeri	well, it's not difficult to make a functional interface.
2018-11-07 10:37:38	@eti	Khorne: that's just an example; it's not only about the ui and ux, obv
2018-11-07 10:37:42	zyeri	but it is definitely hard to make a functional interface look good
2018-11-07 10:37:45	zyeri	oh wow the lag
2018-11-07 10:37:52	+Khorne	eti, but you make a blanket statement which is not exactly true
2018-11-07 10:37:56	@Leliana	zyeri: not really
2018-11-07 10:38:03	@eti	zyeri: but to make a good interface is difficult, anyone can make a shitty interface easily

2018-11-07 10:38:59	@eti	Khorne: alright web design as a whole is something you learn in my opinion. you can't just learn design and then expect someone to make a website
2018-11-07 10:39:14	@Leliana	eti: sure you can
2018-11-07 10:39:21	@Leliana	just start hitting a web designer with a stick
2018-11-07 10:39:21	@eti	when i'm talking about web design i'm talking about working templates, etc; not coding literally
2018-11-07 10:39:24	@Leliana	"make me website now"
2018-11-07 10:40:03	@eti	because that's not web design, web design is the designing part of the job, the code itself, well that's the job of the coder
2018-11-07 10:40:03	zyeri	in terms of difficult (from least difficult to most difficult), it's nonfunctional + looks bad -> functional + looks bad -> non-functional + looks good -> functional + looks good

2018-11-07 15:14:06	@Leliana	still not GAAS
2018-11-07 15:14:11	Ergo	i mean like FFXV

2018-11-07 15:14:51	Ergo	but like by making the game online, its easier to keep feeding of it 
2018-11-07 15:14:59	Ergo	you can do patches, introduce new stuff blabla 
2018-11-07 15:15:15	@Leliana	yeah, you can do that without online games tho
2018-11-07 15:15:17	@Leliana	it's called DLC
2018-11-07 15:15:22	Ergo	i am aware 
2018-11-07 15:15:48	Ergo	but there is a difference to me how CDPR handled DLC for TW3 and how Square Enix did it for FFXV, altho this prolly doesnt deal with games as a service 
2018-11-07 15:15:53	@Leliana	I member when we used to have to download patches off the developer's website :')
2018-11-07 15:16:00	+Khorne	Leliana, haaahaaa.
2018-11-07 15:16:03	+Khorne	haaaa.
2018-11-07 15:16:05	+Khorne	pls no
2018-11-07 15:16:07	+Khorne	lets not
2018-11-07 15:16:09	+Khorne	do that again
2018-11-07 15:16:15	@Leliana	and games weren't half broken at release because it was harder to patch after the fact when people had shitty internet
2018-11-07 15:16:30	@Leliana	now it's "fuck it, we'll put out a day 1 patch"
2018-11-07 15:16:33	Ergo	its not even that, developers couldnt get awway with it as easily 
2018-11-07 15:16:35	+Khorne	which version are you on? 1.23.43245a and you? 1.23.43245b..guess we cant play
2018-11-07 15:16:41	Ergo	like the amount of people that preorder shit is insane
2018-11-07 15:16:45	+Khorne	because who can download the 55mb patch in a single night

2018-11-07 15:16:55	Disrupt	It's 2018.
2018-11-07 15:17:01	Ergo	didnt COD have like a day 1 release patch almost as big as the game itself 
2018-11-07 15:17:02	Ergo	LUL 
2018-11-07 15:17:06	+Cosmonaut	it's current year!
2018-11-07 15:17:07	+Khorne	Disrupt, manual patching is still fucking dense
2018-11-07 15:17:08	@Leliana	there used to be a need for it with physical games as copies could sell out quickly
2018-11-07 15:17:13	@Leliana	there is no scarcity with downloads
2018-11-07 15:17:20	Ergo	its just devs being lazy fucks 
2018-11-07 15:17:22	+Khorne	Disrupt, also as if a patch these days is 50mb only :')
2018-11-07 15:17:33	Ergo	or publishers pushing devs to rush out unfinished products 
2018-11-07 15:17:36	Ergo	id like to believe the latter 
2018-11-07 15:18:36	@Leliana	they can't even say it's to fund the game because preorders usually only start when the game is pretty much finished
2018-11-07 15:19:03	@enju	Ergo that always happened
2018-11-07 15:19:10	@enju	publishers always pushed for certain dates
2018-11-07 15:19:11	@Leliana	it's just a way to push an unfinished product to make quick money knowing you can just patch it later
2018-11-07 15:19:33	Ergo	enju: i dont know man, the witcher 3 felt pretty damn polished when it came out 
2018-11-07 15:19:54	+Khorne	The Witcher 3 is a pretty poor game actually
2018-11-07 15:20:00	Ergo	what the

2018-11-07 15:21:19	Ergo	the first and lost time i pre-ordered was ME:A 
2018-11-07 15:21:22	Ergo	biggest mistake ever 
2018-11-07 15:21:30	@enju	the commonly named worst game of all time was this way because the publisher pushed a date
2018-11-07 15:21:32	Ergo	/s/lost/last/
2018-11-07 15:21:33	@Leliana	for example, the fact the physics engine is tied to framerate

2018-11-07 15:21:59	Ergo	enju: yee , like i should have known better 
2018-11-07 15:22:09	Ergo	but i was blinded by how great the original trilogy was 
2018-11-07 15:22:16	@cosarara	the human eye can't see pass 60fps anyway :^^^^^^^^^^^)
2018-11-07 15:22:24	@cosarara	past
2018-11-07 15:22:38	@Leliana	last time I preordered was skyrim for that supposed "burlap texture" map
2018-11-07 15:22:54	@Leliana	they chose those words very carefully, not quite lying, but misleading knowing full well how people would interpret that
2018-11-07 15:23:04	@Leliana	turns out it was just thick paper with a slightly bumby texture
2018-11-07 15:23:08	@Leliana	bumpy*
2018-11-07 15:23:39	@enju	last time I preordered was DBFZ, 7 minutes before release on steam
2018-11-07 15:23:46	@cosarara	why
2018-11-07 15:24:01	@enju	got 3 chars instead of having to unlock them
2018-11-07 15:24:03	 *	enju shrugs
2018-11-07 15:24:12	@cosarara	i c
2018-11-07 15:24:52	@enju	and the last time before that was LotR: Battle for Middle-earth 2
2018-11-07 15:25:01	@enju	was not dissapointed, still one of my fav RTS games

2018-11-08 10:43:50	+Khorne	Ergo, I mean I'm not surprised people on the 'unixporn discord' have no idea what they're talking about at least
2018-11-08 10:44:08	Ergo	i think it was about how it was cheap

2018-11-08 16:20:30	+nai	should i just put your script in ~/.config/mpv/scripts ? that doesn't seem to do anything

2018-11-08 19:23:24	+nai	problem with this approach is it's an infinite loop, so you won't get instant updates unless you set a very short delay
2018-11-08 19:23:31	+nai	which causes more work for your cpu
2018-11-08 19:23:40	Ergo	ayee , tyee i guess its not efficient 
2018-11-08 19:23:47	+nai	it's better to only update the bar when any single component changes

2018-11-08 19:27:35	+Khorne	Also bars are mostly useless anyways
2018-11-08 19:27:38	+Khorne	:')
2018-11-08 19:27:46	+nai	wew
2018-11-08 19:27:52	Ergo	i think they can be pretty useful 
2018-11-08 19:27:57	Ergo	and they look nice :) 
2018-11-08 19:27:57	+Khorne	Ergo, how
2018-11-08 19:28:08	Ergo	seeing the time , volume control etc 
2018-11-08 19:28:15	Ergo	and ye they look nice
2018-11-08 19:28:24	+Khorne	Most of the information is pretty redundant
2018-11-08 19:28:44	ym	indeed
2018-11-08 19:28:45	+nai	redundant with what
2018-11-08 19:28:47	Ergo	I mean, is ricing in itself very useful? 
2018-11-08 19:29:00	+Khorne	Ergo, depends on who you ask
2018-11-08 19:29:05	+Khorne	:')
2018-11-08 19:29:19	Ergo	i mean i enjoy staring at my pc more if it looks good but thats about it 
2018-11-08 19:29:22	+Khorne	nai, workspace/window indicators are covered for me by active borders
2018-11-08 19:29:31	+Khorne	time is in my tmux statusline already
2018-11-08 19:30:04	Ergo	hmm fish doesnt seem to wanna execute bash stuff 
2018-11-08 19:30:07	+nai	wdym active borders
2018-11-08 19:30:10	+Khorne	volume is the stupidest thing ever because I have shortcuts for that and I really dont care if my volume % is an arbitrary value, if its too silent I increase it, if its too loud I decrease it
2018-11-08 19:30:17	+Khorne	Ergo, well..no shit sherlock
2018-11-08 19:30:25	+Khorne	Thats why you use a shebang
2018-11-08 19:30:27	Ergo	i mean putting a shebang should fix that right 
2018-11-08 19:30:29	Ergo	yee thats what i did 
2018-11-08 19:30:36	+Khorne	is it executable?

2018-11-08 19:30:46	+Khorne	nai, ^
2018-11-08 19:30:50	+nai	how are you running it
2018-11-08 19:30:56	+Khorne	Active window has green border
2018-11-08 19:31:01	+Khorne	Inactive windows do not
2018-11-08 19:31:13	+Khorne	(And yes I know that has a bar)
2018-11-08 19:31:21	+Khorne	Point still stands, it mostly useless
2018-11-08 19:31:27	+nai	focused? well yes that's pretty standard but i don't see what it has to do with a workspace indicator
2018-11-08 19:31:41	+Khorne	nai, well..my workspace is the current workspace
2018-11-08 19:31:47	+Khorne	what else do i need to know
2018-11-08 19:31:55	+Khorne	If i want another workspace i switch to that
2018-11-08 19:32:02	Ergo	nai: i was just trying to run the script for some 
2018-11-08 19:32:03	+Khorne	does it need icons? no, does it need titles? no
2018-11-08 19:32:16	+nai	most useful thing to know is on what ws are your other windows
2018-11-08 19:32:25	Ergo	like i didnt expect it to work 
2018-11-08 19:32:27	Ergo	but the error is weird 
2018-11-08 19:32:32	+Khorne	nai, well..I know that...because I put them there?
2018-11-08 19:32:33	Ergo	The file 'scripts/volume' is marked as an executable but could not be run by the operating system.
2018-11-08 19:32:49	Ergo	when i try it in bash it just gives some useless output , but it does run 
2018-11-08 19:33:00	+nai	Khorne: i mean.. until you have 12 windows open in 6 different workspaces
2018-11-08 19:33:10	+Khorne	nai, no even then
2018-11-08 19:33:20	+nai	or you want to turn off your computer and quickly check if you have windows still open
2018-11-08 19:33:25	Ergo	i never remember that 
2018-11-08 19:33:30	Ergo	always lost 
2018-11-08 19:33:45	+nai	Ergo: show  head -n 1 scripts/volume
2018-11-08 19:33:49	+Khorne	nai, but thats what your session manager controls
2018-11-08 19:34:03	+nai	augh
2018-11-08 19:34:18	Ergo	just gives me #!/bin/bash
2018-11-08 19:34:31	+nai	do you have a /bin/bash ?
2018-11-08 19:34:37	Ergo	yup lol 
2018-11-08 19:34:46	Ergo	the scripts do work if i go into bash 
2018-11-08 19:35:25	+nai	Ergo: show  head -n 1 scripts/volume | cat -ve
2018-11-08 19:35:30	Ergo	is what the output is then

2018-11-08 22:54:07	+Khorne	nuuxe, tbh, gentoo and arch install is pretty much the same
2018-11-08 22:54:11	Ergo	i reallly like gentoo, but i think i left because i fucked up some useflag shit 
2018-11-08 22:54:25	+Khorne	bootstrap, slap a profile on, genkernel, add a few configs, p much done
2018-11-08 22:54:34	+nuuxe	and wait
2018-11-08 22:54:39	Ergo	only thing is that gentoo takes a while to compile 
2018-11-08 22:54:40	+Khorne	OH EXCEPT IT TAKES LIKE 90000 HOURS TO BUILD EVERYTHING
2018-11-08 22:54:48	+Khorne	yea

2018-11-09 00:50:11	Ergo	i get that you would use git 
2018-11-09 00:50:18	Ergo	i meant something like dotdrop or w/e

2018-11-09 00:50:35	Ergo	dotdrop, dotbot etc 
2018-11-09 00:50:46	Ergo	or do you just manually move everything over and then push it? 
2018-11-09 00:51:00	+Khorne	"It also allows to manage different sets of dotfiles. For example you can have a set of dotfiles for your home laptop and a different set for your office desktop. "

2018-11-09 00:51:11	+Khorne	move?

2018-11-12 13:02:30	workodera	Ergo, do you program
2018-11-12 13:02:53	workodera	tbh you should just store your source files outside of your ports repo Ergo 
2018-11-12 13:03:13	Ergo	workodera: nope i dont program at all lol 
2018-11-12 13:03:24	workodera	because some ports have local tar.gz files, for example patches
2018-11-12 13:03:28	Ergo	also how wouuld i accomplish that? 
2018-11-12 13:03:53	Ergo	can i create a dir in home that is used to store source files by default? 
2018-11-12 13:04:18	workodera	in /etc/pkgmk.conf there are commented out values at the botton
2018-11-12 13:04:30	workodera	on of them becing PKGMK_SOURCE_DIR iirc
2018-11-12 13:04:39	Ergo	ahh isee 
2018-11-12 13:04:49	workodera	if you set that value, downloaded files will be downloaded to a set location
2018-11-12 13:05:03	workodera	you can also change the directory of compiled packages 
2018-11-12 13:05:14	workodera	and where to build a package
2018-11-12 13:05:29	workodera	if you create a tmpfs directory you can use this last setting to build in ram btw
2018-11-12 13:06:16	workodera	btw I'm making my own port/package manager for crux, it's long from finished but can do some cool things: github.com/onodera-punpun/prt

2018-11-12 13:08:07	workodera	set*
2018-11-12 13:08:59	workodera	because many times packages have false positive NEW errors (for example if you have lua installed a package might be compiled with lua support, which will result in NEW files)

2018-11-12 16:42:08	Izuru	i dont even know what a repos is
2018-11-12 16:42:17	Izuru	im guessing repository 
2018-11-12 16:42:21	@eti	read the manual
2018-11-12 16:42:26	Izuru	probably like
2018-11-12 16:42:29	Ergo0	eti: tbh its more me asking questions way to soon, before actually trying to figure it out 
2018-11-12 16:42:32	Izuru	like
2018-11-12 16:42:38	Ergo0	its a habit im trying to get rid off

2018-11-12 16:43:10	Ergo0	> why read the manual when you can just ask dumb questions 
2018-11-12 16:43:11	@eti	iirc
2018-11-12 16:43:13	Ergo0	:)))) 
2018-11-12 16:43:37	Izuru	aaaaaaaaaaaa
2018-11-12 16:43:44	Izuru	this is why i use winblows
2018-11-12 16:43:49	Izuru	open .exe
2018-11-12 16:44:24	Izuru	i should really be using linux though
2018-11-12 16:44:26	Izuru	for my server
2018-11-12 16:44:37	Izuru	since i leave it on 24/7 for plex, unifi controller, qbittorrent web ui
2018-11-12 16:44:41	Ergo0	i would argue that linux package management is waaaaaaay better then windows when you get used to it 
2018-11-12 16:44:48	Ergo0	and way simpler as well 
2018-11-12 16:45:07	@eti	package managers are great
2018-11-12 16:45:13	Izuru	my friend told me that
2018-11-12 16:45:13	@eti	.app and .exe were a mistake
2018-11-12 16:45:18	Izuru	i should be using containers or something
2018-11-12 16:45:23	Ergo0	same for launching programs as well 
2018-11-12 16:45:27	Izuru	idk if i said that right
2018-11-12 16:45:34	Izuru	its like some new thing
2018-11-12 16:45:38	@eti	Ergo0: did you realize your nick has a 0 at the end of it
2018-11-12 16:45:41	Izuru	i dont think its even called containers

2018-11-12 16:45:51	@eti	why is that

2018-11-12 16:53:43	Ergo0	i prolly would play fortnite with my friends if their anticheat wasnt shit on linux
2018-11-12 16:53:45	~lxcyp	It's a good game with a high skill ceiling 
2018-11-12 16:53:47	Ergo0	i do think it works nowadays tho 
2018-11-12 16:53:57	Ergo0	i just play OW now 
2018-11-12 16:54:02	~lxcyp	I'm bored of Ow
2018-11-12 16:54:07	icyphox	Ergo0, yeah i would play it too tbh if it weren't for the anticheat 
2018-11-12 16:54:07	Ergo0	in terms of multiplayer games 
2018-11-12 16:54:10	Ergo0	i havent played in a while tho 
2018-11-12 16:54:10	~lxcyp	10 seasons burned me out 
2018-11-12 16:54:21	Ergo0	i still watch OWL tho 
2018-11-12 16:54:23	icyphox	play Dota
2018-11-12 16:54:35	~lxcyp	I just play QC and fortnite now
2018-11-12 16:54:47	~lxcyp	And whatever single player shit I can find time for 
2018-11-12 16:55:01	icyphox	how do u stand the trash playerbase
2018-11-12 16:55:20	~lxcyp	Of fortnite? 
2018-11-12 16:55:27	icyphox	ya
2018-11-12 16:55:44	~lxcyp	It's honestly OK on pc IMHO, it's not like you ever talk to anyone 
2018-11-12 16:55:48	~lxcyp	I play solo and solo duos
2018-11-12 16:55:53	icyphox	oh hm
2018-11-12 16:55:59	~lxcyp	Or with my housemates and partner 
2018-11-12 16:56:23	icyphox	maybe it's just garbo tier in Asia
2018-11-12 16:56:34	icyphox	my roommate plays it all the time
2018-11-12 16:56:38	icyphox	he's always cussing
2018-11-12 16:56:48	icyphox	and whining about the shit players
2018-11-12 16:56:57	~lxcyp	I mean I like it because the player base is so big there's a good mix of trash kids and sweatlords
2018-11-12 16:57:11	icyphox	ya mayb
2018-11-12 16:57:12	~lxcyp	I don't play grouped with random ppl so the trash kids don't bother me
2018-11-12 16:57:27	~lxcyp	I can imagine if ur queueing with random people it's infuriating 
2018-11-12 16:57:31	~lxcyp	It's why I quit overwatch 
2018-11-12 16:57:43	~lxcyp	One bad player or person in a shitty mood ruins the game 
2018-11-12 16:57:58	icyphox	ye agreed
2018-11-12 16:58:10	icyphox	i stopped CS/Dota because of that
2018-11-12 16:58:13	~lxcyp	Quake and fortnite for me now 
2018-11-12 16:58:23	icyphox	anyone playing HS here?
2018-11-12 16:58:33	~lxcyp	Na
2018-11-12 16:58:45	~lxcyp	I liked it but didn't wanna invest money
2018-11-12 16:58:48	icyphox	it's not bad at all
2018-11-12 16:59:10	icyphox	oh yeah that's a massive turn off for me
2018-11-12 16:59:10	~lxcyp	And it seems so hard to win  f2p
2018-11-12 16:59:10	icyphox	i hate p2w
2018-11-12 16:59:10	icyphox	it's such a grind
2018-11-12 16:59:46	~lxcyp	Yea 
2018-11-12 16:59:48	icyphox	but the games are short, less tilting as compared to CS/Dota

2018-11-12 17:00:58	~lxcyp	It's less p2w now actually 
2018-11-12 17:01:03	~lxcyp	Since they reworked runes completely 
2018-11-12 17:01:06	icyphox	what did they change
2018-11-12 17:01:08	icyphox	oh
2018-11-12 17:01:14	icyphox	but buying heros?
2018-11-12 17:01:16	~lxcyp	Runes don't cost any real money anymore to fuck with 
2018-11-12 17:01:17	icyphox	or champs or w/e
2018-11-12 17:01:29	~lxcyp	You still have to buy champs but you get enough blue essence that its not a huge grind 
2018-11-12 17:01:35	~lxcyp	A few games to get a medium priced champ 
2018-11-12 17:01:42	~lxcyp	A little more of a grind to get an expensive one 
2018-11-12 17:01:55	icyphox	well the fact that the person paying has an advantage still exists
2018-11-12 17:02:12	~lxcyp	I mean yeah ur right

2018-11-12 17:46:14	jenkins	it's confusing
2018-11-12 17:46:22	Ergo0	maybe bsd will keep me focused on school lol 
2018-11-12 17:46:29	Ergo0	cause its actually hard to game on there 
2018-11-12 17:46:42	Ergo0	dual booting freebsd + linux lol 
2018-11-12 17:46:43	jenkins	ahah
2018-11-12 17:46:45	icyphox	i'm not sure i like how FreeBSD devs work
2018-11-12 17:46:56	icyphox	i mean, they don't even use the OS they develop
2018-11-12 17:46:58	icyphox	for starters
2018-11-12 17:47:11	Ergo0	how do you know that
2018-11-12 17:47:14	Ergo0	also that seems weird
2018-11-12 17:47:15	jenkins	and they don't like Irc hugs
2018-11-12 17:47:18	Ergo0	what do they use then? 
2018-11-12 17:47:24	icyphox	mostly Macs
2018-11-12 17:47:42	icyphox	it's a well known fact about them lol
2018-11-12 17:47:50	Ergo0	that doesnt have to mean that they dont use freebsd on mac right 
2018-11-12 17:47:52	icyphox	jenkins, and that
2018-11-12 17:48:15	Ergo0	honestly half the reason im on crux is because i like their irc 
2018-11-12 17:48:32	icyphox	see, OpenBSD devs /use/ the OS as their daily driver
2018-11-12 17:48:45	icyphox	oh how do u find CRUX?
2018-11-12 17:49:08	Ergo0	i like it 
2018-11-12 17:49:09	Ergo0	it has its quirks tho 
2018-11-12 17:49:22	icyphox	how long did it take you to setup
2018-11-12 17:49:34	Ergo0	not that long, install is quicker then arch 
2018-11-12 17:49:34	icyphox	it's pretty hands-on isn't it? 
2018-11-12 17:49:36	Ergo0	yeee 
2018-11-12 17:49:43	Ergo0	but it stays out of the way 
2018-11-12 17:49:55	icyphox	hmm
2018-11-12 17:49:59	Ergo0	i love the package management system 
2018-11-12 17:50:05	icyphox	tarballs
2018-11-12 17:50:18	Ergo0	the ports, which are basically that ye 
2018-11-12 17:50:23	Ergo0	but like a buildscript is super simple 
2018-11-12 17:50:35	icyphox	i see

2018-11-12 17:52:28	icyphox	how does the repo system work
2018-11-12 17:52:35	icyphox	centralized somewhere?
2018-11-12 17:52:49	Ergo0	you have the official port collections maintained by the crux team 
2018-11-12 17:53:01	Ergo0	and then there are dozens of user repos 
2018-11-12 17:53:07	icyphox	ah
2018-11-12 17:53:18	Ergo0	of users that maintain their own ports like mine https://github.com/ergo0/crux-ports
2018-11-12 17:53:19	+cappuccino	[ github.com ] GitHub - Ergo0/crux-ports (text/html)
2018-11-12 17:54:06	Ergo0	you can just copy individual ports and collections, and all you really get is the PkgFIle which basically is a bash script that builds the package and installs it 
2018-11-12 17:54:16	icyphox	right
2018-11-12 17:54:56	icyphox	u might wanna fix your `git config user.email` btw

2018-11-12 17:55:16	Ergo0	icyphox: lol, where do you see that 
2018-11-12 17:55:37	icyphox	no i mean, your commits are being made as 'root'
2018-11-12 17:56:03	icyphox	and not as the github user
2018-11-12 17:56:19	Ergo0	oh thats because i have the ports stored in /usr/ports 
2018-11-12 17:56:25	Ergo0	would that impact usage for people ? 
2018-11-12 17:56:25	icyphox	so change your local git email to the one u used to sign-up on github
2018-11-12 17:56:33	icyphox	not really 
2018-11-12 17:56:45	icyphox	it's just... not pretty

2018-11-12 20:19:36	Roserin	fair
2018-11-12 20:19:38	+Khorne	lxcyp, its the entire debian ecosystem thats slightly annoying tbh
2018-11-12 20:19:50	+Khorne	with about 40 downstream patches to every package
2018-11-12 20:19:57	Roserin	lxcyp: they are doing a lot to make Linux mainstream viable, that's true
2018-11-12 20:20:02	~lxcyp	I mean that's a legitimate criticism Khorne 
2018-11-12 20:20:10	~lxcyp	muh stability and such
2018-11-12 20:20:16	+Khorne	lxcyp, used Ubuntu 7.04 to 9.10
2018-11-12 20:20:18	+Khorne	ama
2018-11-12 20:20:51	~lxcyp	i used 9.10 probably
2018-11-12 20:20:59	~lxcyp	that'd put me at about 12yo
2018-11-12 20:21:05	+Khorne	But tbf everything back then was about shite
2018-11-12 20:21:07	~lxcyp	i dont remember being 12 though
2018-11-12 20:21:32	+Khorne	And Canonical pulled a few really questionable moves
2018-11-12 20:21:38	Roserin	true
2018-11-12 20:21:39	~lxcyp	mir was a misfire
2018-11-12 20:21:39	Roserin	but
2018-11-12 20:21:45	~lxcyp	I do not think anyone should let them get away with trying to push mir
2018-11-12 20:21:46	+Khorne	Upstart and mir are debatable in terms of technology
2018-11-12 20:21:48	Roserin	they are doing a lot to make Linux mainstream viable, that's true
2018-11-12 20:21:48	~lxcyp	and they know that too
2018-11-12 20:21:53	~lxcyp	O
2018-11-12 20:21:56	+Khorne	Their store integration and spyware was...meh
2018-11-12 20:21:59	~lxcyp	I'm glad they dropped mir
2018-11-12 20:22:12	~lxcyp	upstart is.. I mean upstart is a debian thing, is it not?
2018-11-12 20:22:28	+Khorne	Rather sure that was grown on ubuntus shitpile
2018-11-12 20:22:35	~lxcyp	you might be right
2018-11-12 20:22:45	Roserin	It isn't anymore... It's systemd as pretty much a standard
2018-11-12 20:22:50	~lxcyp	yea
2018-11-12 20:22:51	~lxcyp	good
2018-11-12 20:22:52	+Khorne	It was written by Scott James Remnant, a former employee of Canonical Ltd.
2018-11-12 20:22:55	+Khorne	ye
2018-11-12 20:23:03	~lxcyp	openrc didn't keep up and systemd is the best init system we have
2018-11-12 20:23:07	+Khorne	Few distros considered picking it up too
2018-11-12 20:23:16	+Khorne	But systemd superceded it quickly
2018-11-12 20:23:36	Roserin	I don't quite get what people use systemd for
2018-11-12 20:23:43	+Khorne	Roserin, everything?
2018-11-12 20:23:50	Roserin	Khorne: like..?
2018-11-12 20:23:57	+Khorne	Which is, unironically, a good thing to me as a systems administrator
2018-11-12 20:24:10	Roserin	that's fair
2018-11-12 20:24:31	+Khorne	I dont need to mess with cron, 4 different logging implementations + plain file logging, a unit is written in like 30s contrary to (some) init scripts
2018-11-12 20:25:36	+Khorne	Also people always claim systemd is bloated af because it ships everything
2018-11-12 20:25:47	+Khorne	But fail to realize that thats a distro decision to ship everything
2018-11-12 20:26:01	+Khorne	And not a forced decision by systemd the project
2018-11-12 20:26:02	~lxcyp	not to mention the alternative is having 20 different monolithic daemons running
2018-11-12 20:26:50	Roserin	I think the criticism is more that it is too complex
2018-11-12 20:27:09	+Khorne	What you can argue about (and probably should) is its integration of udev and similar buses which makes it hard(er) to ship things depending on those without systemd
2018-11-12 20:27:18	+Khorne	Roserin, thats a fucking bullshit criticism tbh
2018-11-12 20:27:34	+Khorne	Software is always complex
2018-11-12 20:27:55	Roserin	so...
2018-11-12 20:28:07	Roserin	the complaint is it breaks "unix philosophy"
2018-11-12 20:28:14	+Khorne	Roserin, so does vim
2018-11-12 20:28:23	Roserin	where one program does one thing, and does it well
2018-11-12 20:28:27	+Khorne	vim not only reads files, it edits them and saves them too

2018-11-12 20:29:08	+Khorne	Roserin, no really, of all things, thats the weakest argument that there is

2018-11-12 20:29:58	Roserin	Khorne: it's actually similar to what you said about udev
2018-11-12 20:30:21	+Khorne	well no.
2018-11-12 20:30:31	Roserin	How so?
2018-11-12 20:30:41	+Khorne	You might mean a similar thing by reducing it to "breaks unix philosophy"
2018-11-12 20:30:59	+Khorne	But as an argument itself its just not good
2018-11-12 20:31:48	+Khorne	And to be honest if we were going by that we'd be stuck with coreutils for everything
2018-11-12 20:32:05	Roserin	I like coreutils
2018-11-12 20:32:08	jenkins	what about the argument that it's too big and complicated, and constantly extended by engineers who are paid to develop it?
2018-11-12 20:32:28	+Khorne	jenkins, what about the linux kernel then?
2018-11-12 20:32:30	jenkins	that it constitues a security issue
2018-11-12 20:32:43	jenkins	Khorne: it's a common argument against linux as well
2018-11-12 20:32:45	Roserin	Khorne: it's mostly drivers
2018-11-12 20:33:03	+Khorne	jenkins, I dont see people rioting over the kernel though :')
2018-11-12 20:33:07	Roserin	also that gets into microkernel vs monolithic kernel
2018-11-12 20:33:37	jenkins	eh.. I guess
2018-11-12 20:33:40	+Khorne	jenkins, and I really dont see whats wrong with software by people who are paid for developping software?
2018-11-12 20:34:05	+Khorne	Or is the concern really *who* pays them?
2018-11-12 20:34:15	jenkins	it makes it grow even faster and get more complicated
2018-11-12 20:34:18	+Khorne	(Who do you think *owns* the software developers?)
2018-11-12 20:34:48	jenkins	it's now like this will be audited too often, in ever
2018-11-12 20:34:52	jenkins	*if
2018-11-12 20:35:13	+Khorne	jenkins, I mean, I would have to research it, but I'm pretty sure I could guarantuee you that every 'brand' FOSS project has contributions from paid developers
2018-11-12 20:35:23	Roserin	probably
2018-11-12 20:35:43	jenkins	I don't mind paid developers
2018-11-12 20:35:49	Roserin	you think intel doesn't pay people to contribute to linux
2018-11-12 20:36:10	Roserin	or AMD? Or loads of other companies?
2018-11-12 20:36:16	Roserin	but not NVidia...
2018-11-12 20:36:23	jenkins	but a coordinated effort with lots of money being put into something like this is a bit unsettling

2018-11-12 23:27:56	+nai	here i'm asking the shell to open this fd for itself, not for a command it's about to run
2018-11-12 23:28:16	+nai	also the last exec should be  exec 3>&-  (that closes fd 3)

2018-11-13 00:29:29	Roserin	i like the blur
2018-11-13 00:30:51	Ergo	naturally, thats why ur using it 
2018-11-13 00:31:02	Ergo	isnt blur also a massive cpu/gpu hog? 
2018-11-13 00:31:20	Roserin	I feel that the wallpaper would be too distracting without blur
2018-11-13 00:31:30	Ergo	how? 
2018-11-13 00:31:35	Ergo	you wouldnt see it right 
2018-11-13 00:32:37	Roserin	without blur but with transparency
2018-11-13 00:32:50	Roserin	and if i had neither id not get any of the wallpaper
2018-11-13 00:33:01	Roserin	surprisingly, the blur isn't too bad
2018-11-13 00:33:12	Roserin	I had a VM running
2018-11-13 00:33:19	Roserin	it was using a lot of memory
2018-11-13 00:33:39	Roserin	and firefox is of course using like 2G
2018-11-13 00:34:12	Ergo	ahhh sure, i guess that makes sense 
2018-11-13 00:34:19	Ergo	you could also go for no blur and no transparency :) 
2018-11-13 00:35:31	Roserin	then I wouldn't see any of my pretty pretty wallpaper

2018-11-14 00:13:10	+Khorne	or...four times.
2018-11-14 00:13:13	Ergo	well i feel like terminal.sexy should have this option smh

2018-11-14 01:12:15	@mobo	acting retarded is so much fun
2018-11-14 01:12:30	murf	mobo, of rivers and religion or the legend of blind joe death i think sligo river blues is one of my favorite songs of all time though 
2018-11-14 01:12:30	+Khorne	"Many cable manufacturers end their exploration of directionality there, going only as far as to mark their cables for directionality based on the relationship of shield to ground, but altogether neglecting conductor dir"
2018-11-14 01:12:32	+nai	Khorne: this definition of directionality might actually make sense
2018-11-14 01:12:40	+nai	like idk, i don't know electronics enough
2018-11-14 01:12:47	+Khorne	copper doesnt care
2018-11-14 01:12:52	+nai	as long as they're not claiming the conductor itself is directional, who knows
2018-11-14 01:12:52	@mobo	murf: which blind joe death is that? the original or one of the remakes?
2018-11-14 01:13:09	@mobo	not a huge fan of the versions with the bands, but that version of steamboat gwine round de bend is amazing
2018-11-14 01:13:35	+Khorne	nai, I mean entertain their thought for a bit
2018-11-14 01:13:44	+Khorne	In order to fabricate copper or silver into a strand or conductor, it must first be cast and then drawn through a die—a process that inevitably creates a directional, chevron-like pattern in the conductor’s internal grain structure and a non-symmetrical overlay of grains at the conductor’s surface.
2018-11-14 01:13:52	+Khorne	Thats a whole lot of mumbo jumbo
2018-11-14 01:14:13	+Khorne	The real question is....how do you connect things then :')
2018-11-14 01:14:13	@mobo	also, I wanna record my version of sligo river so you can judge me
2018-11-14 01:14:14	+nai	oh jesus
2018-11-14 01:14:24	+nai	that's definitely bullshit
2018-11-14 01:14:41	murf	mobo, the original. "I wish i knew how it would feel to be free" is such a good song but i get what you mean about the bands

2018-11-28 19:03:33	fsckoff	windows 95 was what pushed me to linux. my dad had a paid microsoft network membership and for $20 at the time you could get into the windows chicago beta (win95) so because my dad and i have the same name, so i used his membership to get the like 40 floppy disk beta. hated it, and someone told me about slackware so i installed that.
2018-11-28 19:03:38	@Leliana	I do this, nginx returns 410 for any host not explicitly defined as a server

2018-11-28 19:04:21	@Leliana	but regarding other services, there isn't a thing you can do about another domain pointing at you
2018-11-28 19:04:54	fsckoff	dysfigured: how did that happen? both of you have dynamic ips and the domain owner just hasn't updated their A records yet?

2018-12-03 18:23:41	+Cosumu	parametric polymorphization annoyed me at one point in c
2018-12-03 18:23:43	+Cosumu	wew
2018-12-03 18:24:17	+nai	i think C is weird when it comes to the syntax of types, or variable lifetime; also the naming conventions for the libs are just terrible
2018-12-03 18:24:25	+Cosumu	but at the same time your gonna run into hardware limits with that sort of thing
2018-12-03 18:24:53	+Cosumu	nai: no u
2018-12-03 18:25:02	+nai	wtf is parametric polymorphization though
2018-12-03 18:25:13	+Cosumu	In programming languages and type theory, parametric polymorphism is a way to make a language more expressive, while still maintaining full static type-safety. Using parametric polymorphism, a function or a data type can be written generically so that it can handle values identically without depending on their type.[1] Such functions and data types are called generic functions and generic
2018-12-03 18:25:15	+Cosumu	datatypes respectively and form the basis of generic programming. 
2018-12-03 18:25:17	+Cosumu	there you go
2018-12-03 18:25:19	+Cosumu	smh
2018-12-03 18:25:26	+nai	...in C?
2018-12-03 18:25:31	+Cosumu	you can't do it in c
2018-12-03 18:25:32	+nai	does C have templates?
2018-12-03 18:25:38	+nai	<+Cosumu> parametric polymorphization annoyed me at one point in c 
2018-12-03 18:25:47	+Cosumu	nai: bc i couldn't do it
2018-12-03 18:25:49	+Cosumu	thats why it annoyed me

2018-12-03 18:26:23	+Cosumu	nai: no i was wrote a thing and was tryna port a thing to c and it was annoying
2018-12-03 18:26:28	oepsie	Like in C if you mke a linked list for ints you have to redefine one if you mke it for float.
2018-12-03 18:26:32	+nai	yes i actually know what generics and templates are, i just wasn't sure due to Cosumu's sentence
2018-12-03 18:26:38	oepsie	Rather than having a linked_list<X> where X is a type variable.
2018-12-03 18:26:43	oepsie	Ahh
2018-12-03 18:26:50	oepsie	"geerics" are a special case of parametric polymorphization I guess
2018-12-03 18:27:02	+nai	geerics
2018-12-03 18:27:05	+Cosumu	i mean if your called c retarded your probs just using it for the wrong things
2018-12-03 18:27:29	oepsie	Modulo historical inertia I feel there is no right thing for C.
2018-12-03 18:27:34	oepsie	Ot since things like Rust came along.
2018-12-03 18:27:49	+Cosumu	its useful for embedded

2018-12-03 18:28:41	oepsie	You can do it with Rust too but with more type safety and less code.

2018-12-03 18:29:30	+Cosumu	also confession i've never used rust

2018-12-03 18:34:18	oepsie	Everyone is so ooold.
2018-12-03 18:34:47	oepsie	To be fair though most of the maturity and optimization of C compiles happens at the backend which is nowadays shared between many lanuages.
2018-12-03 18:35:00	oepsie	Like the absolute lion's share of the optimizations that Rsutc performs is done by llvm.
