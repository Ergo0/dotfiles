2018-12-18 15:55:08	+bushidoboy	Only thing I don't like is that it's an open world game

2018-12-18 15:55:24	@enju	I dont like them that much either
2018-12-18 15:55:28	+bushidoboy	Basically screams 10h of main story, and 1000 of side quests
2018-12-18 15:55:48	@enju	nah its a solid 50h mainstory minimum
2018-12-18 15:55:51	+bushidoboy	which is fine, and it definitely gives it replay value and reason to come back, but I'll never really feel I'm done without a huge time investment
2018-12-18 15:56:09	+bushidoboy	yeah 50h for main story, no side quests is still a huge endeavor
2018-12-18 15:56:25	+bushidoboy	at 2h of gameplay a day that's still almost a whole month
2018-12-18 15:56:26	noise	noise
2018-12-18 15:56:26	@enju	I only did main story, dlc main quests and am at 100h atm
2018-12-18 15:56:41	@enju	bushidoboy true, but it doesnt go anywhere ya know
2018-12-18 15:56:54	+bushidoboy	I'm probably gonna hold off until KH3 comes out and I beat that
2018-12-18 15:56:58	@enju	its not like you miss out on anything if you need a year or so
2018-12-18 15:57:15	+bushidoboy	because that's been a 13 year time investment and it's important that I finish that asap
2018-12-18 15:57:30	@enju	lmao
2018-12-18 15:57:38	@enju	speaking of 13 years
2018-12-18 15:57:49	@enju	I realised the last SoAD album was 13 years ago
2018-12-18 15:57:56	@enju	and im not sure I want a new one at this point

2018-12-19 16:36:50	deviantfero	on spotify
2018-12-19 16:36:52	+Khorne	Spotify? No clue
2018-12-19 16:36:57	+Khorne	I use google play music :')
2018-12-19 16:36:58	deviantfero	I'd love to use mopidy
2018-12-19 16:37:03	+Khorne	mopidy sucks ass
2018-12-19 16:37:10	deviantfero	it's written in python 2
2018-12-19 16:37:18	+Khorne	It sucks ass for other reasons tbh
2018-12-19 16:37:22	deviantfero	why in $CURRENT_YEAR?
2018-12-19 16:37:25	deviantfero	how so?
2018-12-19 16:37:40	+Khorne	I assume you want to use an mpd client as frontend
2018-12-19 16:37:48	+Khorne	Those cant really deal with streaming services nicely

2018-12-19 16:38:05	+Khorne	Cant 'add' shit to libraries, only playlists
2018-12-19 16:38:12	deviantfero	hmm
2018-12-19 16:38:16	deviantfero	sounds shitty
2018-12-19 16:38:23	deviantfero	also sounds like a good project
2018-12-19 16:38:29	+Khorne	I mean..the idea is nice
2018-12-19 16:38:30	deviantfero	but I can't find the damn time
2018-12-19 16:38:45	+Khorne	Also esp spotify closed down libspotify iirc
2018-12-19 16:38:52	+Khorne	and the gpm api isnt too great either
2018-12-19 16:39:00	alan	mopidy is awful for Spotify especially when adding large playlists 
2018-12-19 16:39:06	+Khorne	^
2018-12-19 16:39:22	alan	I had to split my library up in 10 or so playlists without it hanging 
2018-12-19 16:39:34	+Khorne	I'm happy enough with google play music desktop..considering its electron of all things
2018-12-19 16:39:38	+Khorne	but whatcha gonna do

2018-12-19 16:40:09	m0rkai	The last time I went for them testing, I needed stronger glasses 
2018-12-19 16:40:26	+Khorne	alan, meh, then I'm stuck at copying shit around again or exhausting my mobile data
2018-12-19 16:40:37	m0rkai	And the optician dude was all 'now, don't think if it as getting worse, just different'
2018-12-19 16:40:42	m0rkai	Like trying to comfort me or something 
2018-12-19 16:40:47	+Cosmonaut	can't you download your Google play stuff locally and not use data
2018-12-19 16:40:51	alan	Oh yeah mobile data. I just copy my music over from my smb share overnight. 
2018-12-19 16:40:55	m0rkai	I was like eh ok dude just give me the damn specs 
2018-12-19 16:41:01	+Cosmonaut	Spotify does that tbh
2018-12-19 16:41:07	+Khorne	Cosmonaut, to my phone
2018-12-19 16:41:13	+Khorne	all of google plays library?
2018-12-19 16:41:33	+Cosmonaut	no
2018-12-19 16:41:39	+Cosmonaut	all of your saved tanks
2018-12-19 16:41:42	+Cosmonaut	tracks
2018-12-19 16:42:02	+Khorne	I mean, yes I can make playlists and albums available locally (and could download everything I uploaded)
2018-12-19 16:42:17	+Khorne	But that kinda defeats the point of streaming music aka listening to whatever I want whenever I want
2018-12-19 16:42:23	+Rue	eti: aha nah. i got sidetracked. but ya the font is good now. earlier the difference is kind of like what this pic demonstrates: https://i.stack.imgur.com/1gJ6u.png
2018-12-19 16:42:53	alan	The way gpm handles downloads annoyed me since I had to throw everything into a playlist instead of just flipping a switch on my library. 
2018-12-19 16:43:00	+Khorne	alan, wdym
2018-12-19 16:43:10	+Khorne	you can download single albums
2018-12-19 16:43:24	+Cosmonaut	it will at least minimize data usage if you don't only listen to stuff you've never heard
2018-12-19 16:43:31	+Cosmonaut	or get better data plan idk
2018-12-19 16:43:32	+Khorne	Cosmonaut, well yes
2018-12-19 16:43:38	+Khorne	Get a 100? data plan :')
2018-12-19 16:43:42	+Khorne	nothanks
2018-12-19 16:43:51	+Cosmonaut	what kind of commie shit hole
2018-12-19 16:43:59	alan	$100 for unlimited data 
2018-12-19 16:44:05	+Khorne	>unlimited
2018-12-19 16:44:07	+Khorne	lmao
2018-12-19 16:44:10	+Khorne	no that'd be 50GB or something
2018-12-19 16:44:36	+Cosmonaut	do you stream flaca
2018-12-19 16:44:39	+Cosmonaut	flacs
2018-12-19 16:44:49	+Khorne	Hu, actually there is unlimited fopr 60?
2018-12-19 16:44:52	alan	Only when there's congestion and since I live in a small town that Verizon and Att has a strong grasp on, I don't get throttled 
2018-12-19 16:44:57	+Khorne	I guess I havent checked plans in a while :')
2018-12-19 16:45:35	+Khorne	Cosmonaut, but all in all that seems rather pointless
2018-12-19 16:46:20	alan	I don't stream music anymore. Sucks my battery life and kinda pointless if I have everything in FLAC. 
2018-12-19 16:46:34	+Khorne	I also cba to download shit anymore

2018-12-19 17:07:24	deviantfero	the speed is relatively slow
2018-12-19 17:07:29	alan	$60 for 100mbps no cap

2018-12-19 17:08:06	+Cosmonaut	$70 for 500mbps no caps :)
2018-12-19 17:08:11	alan	bc they're ripoffs or they live in the middle of nowhere I guess 
2018-12-19 17:08:19	deviantfero	I'm guessing most of those situations are because there are no other providers
2018-12-19 17:08:33	deviantfero	in the zone, so they fuck'em over

2018-12-20 07:59:28	oepsie	have you ever noticed that in oriental media the characters often have a more designed and defined aesthetic to them.
2018-12-20 07:59:38	oepsie	Like in a lot of eurogenetic media the characters look very plain
2018-12-20 07:59:47	oepsie	But in oriental media they tend to look larger than life in their aesthetic
2018-12-20 08:00:33	~lxcyp	I get what you're saying but I think a lot of western animation is good at that too 
2018-12-20 08:01:21	oepsie	I don't know when you like look at big eurogenetic things like Spider-Man or Spirou they sort of look bland

2018-12-20 08:02:07	oepsie	Big oriental things like Goku or Edward Elric areimmediately recognizable and have at least very designed quintessential haircuts.
2018-12-20 08:02:28	oepsie	Though The Matrix also did that but they clearly took a lot of inspiration from oriental media.

2018-12-20 11:48:54	+Rue	romanian girls are pretty hot though
2018-12-20 11:49:20	+nai	but that doesn't tell you about the country's wealth now
2018-12-20 11:49:29	+nai	just tells you poor people emigrated some generations ago
2018-12-20 11:49:31	@enju	nai the cities are close to normal europe, the country side might aswell be 1920
2018-12-20 11:49:42	+nai	ok
2018-12-20 11:49:48	@enju	nai those emigrated since romania joining the EU
2018-12-20 11:49:57	@enju	because you dont need a visa
2018-12-20 11:50:07	+nai	i guess
2018-12-20 11:50:21	@enju	a lot of workers coming to the rest of europe
2018-12-20 11:50:46	@enju	because they work for romanian companies so they dont have to uphold minimum wage, but they still make more than just staying in romania
2018-12-20 11:50:55	@enju	everyone loses, but companies win
2018-12-20 11:50:57	@enju	fun

2018-12-20 14:28:09	+Rue	go with no bar
2018-12-20 15:28:20	Ergo	i need a bar, cause i always lose track of time without one 
2018-12-20 14:28:26	+Khorne	implying lemonbar (or rather half of its feeder scripts) isnt bloated shit
2018-12-20 15:28:37	Ergo	like yesterday i was an hour late to my barbers appointment
2018-12-20 15:28:41	Ergo	because i lost track of time

2018-12-20 15:29:58	Ergo	but i could also just have ab ar

2018-12-20 15:30:52	Ergo	but i didnt like tint2 when i tried it 
2018-12-20 14:31:00	@enju	and a lot of unoptimized scripts
2018-12-20 14:31:25	+Khorne	enju, i mean sure its w/e, doesnt really matter..but people keep calling pb bloated
2018-12-20 14:31:37	@enju	lemonbar can be pretty slim
2018-12-20 14:31:45	@enju	itself its pretty slim actually
2018-12-20 14:31:50	+Khorne	and yet they run some weird ass bash script that polls every 2s for some shit into dzen or w/e
2018-12-20 14:31:52	@enju	the scripts feeding it on the other hand
2018-12-20 14:33:01	+Khorne	exactly my point
2018-12-20 15:33:10	Ergo	they also kinda look the same right

2018-12-20 23:16:41	Etiv	it's camp but doesn't blow the campiness up to absurd proportions like future funk and vaporwave does

2018-12-20 23:24:50	@cosarara	why would people go back to this in 2018? we have fucking digital media
2018-12-20 23:25:02	@cosarara	just use digital storage
2018-12-20 23:25:11	@enju	because it adds a certain feel to it
2018-12-20 23:25:19	@enju	and tape sucks extra in your car
2018-12-20 23:25:26	@enju	because the speakers also fucking suck in your car
2018-12-20 23:25:35	@enju	they sound perfectly fine on my hifi system
2018-12-20 23:25:51	@enju	also people do it
2018-12-20 23:25:54	@enju	cause digital kinda sucks
2018-12-20 23:38:49	@cosarara	why would digital suck
2018-12-20 23:39:06	@cosarara	it's more convenient
2018-12-20 23:39:16	@enju	its also more boring
