2018-12-18 12:43:25	PCatinean	j0nnymoe, so I activated the reverse proxy by changing the name
2018-12-18 12:43:38	PCatinean	and inside the server name I placed the full dns and I still get the "Welcome" message from nginx
2018-12-18 12:45:58	j0nnymoe	I personally haven't used a duckdns address with the reverse proxy configs, I've only used full domains
2018-12-18 12:46:31	j0nnymoe	check your nginx logs to see what's happening when it's being accessed
2018-12-18 12:47:35	PCatinean	it just shows me the regular screen from the fresh install
2018-12-18 12:48:32	j0nnymoe	I mean in /config/nginx/logs/

2018-12-18 12:59:56	Nebukadneza	i wondered why a project that focuses on FOSS like linuxserver.io uses such a terminally closed and ostracizing mean of communication [discord] as main-chat anyways ? ?
2018-12-18 13:02:09	j0nnymoe	Nebukadneza, easier for support
2018-12-18 13:02:28	j0nnymoe	irc is -ok- but no history/image/markdown support
2018-12-18 13:03:23	j0nnymoe	plus we use it for internal comms
2018-12-18 13:03:26	Nebukadneza	there are free, federated and modern protocols that feature such
2018-12-18 13:03:34	Nebukadneza	for example matrix
2018-12-18 13:03:39	j0nnymoe	it's more ease of access for the user
2018-12-18 13:03:50	Nebukadneza	also xmpp if you maintain the server well, but i see there?s a problem with xmpp
2018-12-18 13:04:03	Nebukadneza	the common matrix clients otoh are very end-user friendly
2018-12-18 13:04:29	j0nnymoe	maybe it's something we will review at some point
2018-12-18 13:04:32	j0nnymoe	but discord works well for us
2018-12-18 13:06:36	Nebukadneza	mh yes, but their privacy practices and usage contract/eula does in fact stop users from being able to enter it
2018-12-18 13:07:36	Nebukadneza	i feel that as a open community producing and using free software, this is a point not to be neglected
2018-12-18 13:07:49	Nebukadneza	still, i don?t want to only whine around ? just something to maybe think about one day ^_^
2018-12-18 13:07:59	j0nnymoe	well that's why we keep the irc open ;)
2018-12-18 13:08:29	j0nnymoe	Just I monitor it less here
2018-12-18 13:08:38	j0nnymoe	due to no decent mobile android apps
2018-12-18 13:10:23	Nebukadneza	*cough* matrix has a broad bridging ecosystem ? irc among others

2018-12-19 13:56:48	j0nnymoe	we don't have an emby image
2018-12-19 13:57:13	j0nnymoe	Rawh, well it's x86_64 ;)

2018-12-19 13:57:39	Rawh	>.>
2018-12-19 13:57:46	j0nnymoe	put your docker run command for jackett on a pastebin

2018-12-19 14:05:35	Rawh	Wasn't jacket updated yesterday
2018-12-19 14:05:45	Rawh	I remember getting a push notify about it from pushover
2018-12-19 14:05:50	j0nnymoe	gets updated as and when the dev's push a release
2018-12-19 14:05:56	Rawh	(i haven't updated yet) 
2018-12-19 14:07:36	j0nnymoe	kornflex, https://pastebin.com/FXPa4FN9
2018-12-19 14:07:37	j0nnymoe	worked here
2018-12-19 14:09:07	kornflex	ok.... so it's me, i will find :)
2018-12-19 14:09:52	kornflex	is it possible to delete and clear cache a the image ?
2018-12-19 14:10:11	kornflex	i try to delete it, but still there, so I can download all the image
2018-12-19 14:10:27	kornflex	I had a CRC problem like 
2018-12-19 14:10:30	Rawh	run 'docker images'
2018-12-19 14:10:38	Rawh	and then 'docker rmi -f <image-id>'
2018-12-19 14:11:12	Rawh	that should take care of the image if there was an ERR in downloadit it
2018-12-19 14:11:15	Rawh	downloading* 
2018-12-19 14:11:49	kornflex	OK I will try these commands
2018-12-19 14:12:08	kornflex	frist delete container, then iamge
2018-12-19 14:12:38	Rawh	if you still have the container, yes
2018-12-19 14:12:42	Rawh	but it will tell you ;)
2018-12-19 14:13:35	kornflex	container not yet deleted... very slow...
2018-12-19 14:15:24	Rawh	Are your images installed / running on the syno array, or on a dedicated ssd ?
2018-12-19 14:15:48	kornflex	on syno array
2018-12-19 14:16:11	kornflex	if the container can start, it's quick
2018-12-19 14:16:34	kornflex	but this one is slow....
2018-12-19 14:17:47	kornflex	docker rmi -f will delete the image and the cache ?
2018-12-19 14:18:21	kornflex	great it's done !
2018-12-19 14:18:30	kornflex	let's start again, and again 
2018-12-19 14:19:15	-->	headcase (~headcase@unaffiliated/headcase) has joined #linuxserver.io
2018-12-19 14:19:16	kornflex	doker pull : image already exists...
2018-12-19 14:19:49	j0nnymoe	doesn't synology have some sort of docker gui you can use to remove images?
2018-12-19 14:19:50	Rawh	All images or just partilly ?
2018-12-19 14:20:12	kornflex	yes, syno has a webUI for docker
2018-12-19 14:20:33	kornflex	but it wasn't ok, so I use bash to have errors
2018-12-19 14:20:59	Rawh	maybe use portainer instead? (it's a docker image to manage docker with gui) 
2018-12-19 14:21:15	Rawh	Though in all honesty, there is no real way to remove cache
2018-12-19 14:21:47	Rawh	you can delete the '/var/lib/docker' directory, but you'll lose everything >.<
2018-12-19 14:22:06	Rawh	That it however as close you can get to cache deletion
2018-12-19 14:25:49	kornflex	it's not possible to create a container wtih a tar file ?
2018-12-19 14:26:04	kornflex	unstead of the repository ? 
2018-12-19 14:27:16	kornflex	or try with an other repo for x86 arch
2018-12-19 14:31:12	Rawh	kornflex: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40582300/how-to-load-docker-image-from-tar-file
2018-12-19 14:38:40	kornflex	I use this repo : https://hub.docker.com/r/orbnedron/jackett/
2018-12-19 14:38:45	kornflex	it works...
2018-12-19 14:39:19	kornflex	thank you for your help
2018-12-19 14:39:23	kornflex	and time
2018-12-19 14:40:14	kornflex	I think, I had a problem when downloading the new image automaticaly with watchtower ... 
2018-12-19 14:46:04	j0nnymoe	we as a group don't recommend watchtower
2018-12-19 14:46:16	j0nnymoe	use docker-compose or create a bash script
2018-12-19 15:05:45	kornflex	ok i will see it
