2018-11-28 12:05:39	Veyrdite	Also: are you on libc or musl and have you changed your mirrors from the defaults?

2018-11-28 12:06:10	Veyrdite	Wow.  Okay.
2018-11-28 12:06:12	ergo0	the fonts in lxappearance and rofi are all jittery tho

2018-11-28 12:06:27	ergo0	nope 
2018-11-28 12:06:36	ergo0	as in there is no text lol, just some odd squares or circles 
2018-11-28 12:06:50	Veyrdite	Sounds like Xorg is not properly installed
2018-11-28 12:06:57	Veyrdite	Or at least the fonts for it
2018-11-28 12:07:10	Veyrdite	Do you have 'xorg-fonts' installed?
2018-11-28 12:07:13	ergo0	nope 
2018-11-28 12:07:16	ergo0	im installing those now 
2018-11-28 12:07:21	Veyrdite	That should definately come with xorg
2018-11-28 12:07:29	Veyrdite	Also install at least one ttf font, eg Dejavu

2018-11-28 12:08:08	Veyrdite	Need to save the space?
2018-11-28 12:08:09	ergo0	fixed firefox?? 
2018-11-28 12:08:23	Veyrdite	?
2018-11-28 12:08:31	ergo0	yee after installing fonts, firefox worked 
2018-11-28 12:08:51	Veyrdite	Ah, you mean '!!' not '??' then
2018-11-28 12:08:53	ergo0	chromium as well 
2018-11-28 12:09:01	ergo0	i meant it as "well that is weird" 
2018-11-28 12:09:21	Veyrdite	Whilst those apps might not use those fonts directly, they might depend on some xlibs that do need those fonts
2018-11-28 12:09:44	ergo0	welp, alsa says my laptop doesnt have a capture device
2018-11-28 12:09:44	Veyrdite	xorg-fonts is generally considered something that's "always installed", so devs don't test their apps without it (or even know xorg-fonts exists)
2018-11-28 12:09:47	ergo0	its prolly some acer bs 
2018-11-28 12:09:55	Veyrdite	ergo0: Make sure to press TAB in alsa mixer
2018-11-28 12:09:59	ergo0	i did 
2018-11-28 12:10:13	ergo0	tab just takes me to "no input devices found" 
2018-11-28 12:10:22	Veyrdite	Oh dear.  Might be firmware or modules related, have a read of 'dmesg' and see if it gives any hints
2018-11-28 12:10:33	Veyrdite	dmesg | grep -i snd,   dmes | grep -i audio,   etc
2018-11-28 12:11:29	Veyrdite	It's also worth looking up your model of laptop with the word 'linux' on the web, it might be a common problem.
2018-11-28 12:12:06	ergo0	ye, was about to do that, here is output btw

2018-11-28 12:12:58	Veyrdite	All I can suggest is to keep looking, reading and searching.
2018-11-28 12:13:22	 *	Veyrdite imagines in an alternate dimension there's "acer-mixer"
2018-11-28 12:13:48	ergo0	lol, wish that was true 
2018-11-28 12:14:35	Veyrdite	Careful what you wish for.
2018-11-28 12:15:05	Veyrdite	It launches a copy of wine running a vista-era-appearance big GUI application that drags in two javascript frameworks and advertising.

2018-11-28 12:28:36	Veyrdite	Main devs are not a fan of it in its current form
2018-11-28 12:28:53	Veyrdite	Might be worth putting it on the Arch Linux wiki, or gentoo, or alike.

2018-11-28 12:29:17	ronin7z	and yee could do that as well, never did anything like that before tho 
2018-11-28 12:30:03	Veyrdite	The wiki is not tidy or up to date.  The devs don't like what it has become and are instead moving to centralised documentation.

2018-11-28 17:33:33	ronin7z	Sslasher: welp, the post is down but i can still help u if need be 
2018-11-28 17:33:47	Sslasher	sorry just realized i wrote to you right after you disconnected
2018-11-28 17:33:52	ronin7z	yee doesnt matter 
2018-11-28 17:34:06	ronin7z	i will pastebin it and send it to you 
2018-11-28 17:34:15	Sslasher	ok, sure, i can take a look
2018-11-28 17:35:09	ronin7z	Sslasher: this should work - https://bpaste.net/show/184b6d90cc0e 
2018-11-28 17:35:15	ronin7z	you can prolly skip the first 2 things 
2018-11-28 17:35:16	nightmared	voidfan: sure thing ;)
2018-11-28 17:36:20	Sslasher	oh is this a script to patch the source, then get xbps-src to build it for you?
2018-11-28 17:36:33	ronin7z	Sslasher: yess 
2018-11-28 17:36:35	voidfan	Also what PDF reader would you recommend?
2018-11-28 17:36:36	Sslasher	i wasn't using xbps-src at all, just compiling directly

2018-11-28 17:36:53	Pestdoktor	voidfan: firefox :P
2018-11-28 17:37:00	ronin7z	i mean might be, this is how i always do it. this is updated with the checksum fix btw - https://bpaste.net/show/9d1150b1b53d
2018-11-28 17:37:18	ronin7z	its pretty simple actually

2018-11-28 17:38:30	nightmared	or the mate equivalent if you don't like CSD
2018-11-28 17:38:34	Sslasher	ok, i saved all that, in case i need it
2018-11-28 17:39:01	voidfan	nightmared: Thanks. I'll give that one a try
2018-11-28 17:39:31	Sslasher	i feel like ghostview was good for viewing pdfs, a long time ago? don't know where it stands now
2018-11-28 17:39:42	nightmared	evinve is "Document viewer", the gnome pdf reader
2018-11-28 17:39:47	nightmared	evince*
2018-11-28 17:40:29	voidfan	Well just because it's gnome doesn't mean that it's that bad ;)
2018-11-28 17:40:32	nightmared	Sslasher: and mupdf was working fairly well on RPi1 too, doesn't mean it's the easiest to use/just works
2018-11-28 17:41:18	ronin7z	i just use zathura + mupdf to read pdfs
2018-11-28 17:41:20	ronin7z	 works pretty well 
2018-11-28 17:41:41	nightmared	that wasn't what I was implying, it's just people dislike CSD (on wayland particularly :p), in which case its MATE alternative is the same software, minus the decoration bar
2018-11-28 17:42:34	Sslasher	i didn't mean to argue, i haven't viewed a pdf on linux in ~15 years, but i mentioned ghostview in case it suits him
2018-11-28 17:42:44	shizonic	@devs Any chance to get a nim build_style?

2018-11-28 17:52:52	voidfan	I'm desperately trying to squash my commits and I screw up every time.

2018-11-28 17:54:22	voidfan	I wanted less commits and not more ;p
2018-11-28 17:54:27	Sslasher	speaking of git, i don't have a github account, is there another way to report the wrong dependencies in ffmpeg-devel-32bit?
2018-11-28 17:54:40	maxice8[m]	voidfan:  git rebase upstream/master
2018-11-28 17:55:13	maxice8[m]	Sslasher: There is #xbps but really using GItHub is the way
2018-11-28 17:55:45	voidfan	Yes. I did that.
2018-11-28 17:55:55	Sslasher	alright
2018-11-28 17:56:02	Pestdoktor	rebase -i usually works well for me
