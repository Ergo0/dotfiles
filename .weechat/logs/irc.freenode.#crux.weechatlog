2018-11-05 23:26:56	ronin7z	or should i make em from scratch 
2018-11-05 23:38:12	Anselmo	they're still up I think, on the github page for 6c37
2018-11-05 23:39:22	ronin7z	the github page gives me a 404 unfortunately 
2018-11-05 23:41:05	Anselmo	https://github.com/6c37/crux-ports ?

2018-11-06 10:57:46	Necrosporus	This is from /etc/rc
2018-11-06 10:58:25	Necrosporus	May I suggest to change the condition to checking if there LVM volumes in fstab maybe?
2018-11-06 10:59:14	Necrosporus	I have LVM installed because I want to mount external HDD occasionally but I don't use LVM for the system
2018-11-06 10:59:58	joacim	which drives have and don't have lvm wouldn't show in fstab. you mount the volume, not the underlying drive.
2018-11-06 11:00:57	Necrosporus	joacim, if fstab has something like /dev/mapper then it's likely LVM, if it has /dev/sda1 then it is not
2018-11-06 11:03:23	joacim	i am aware
2018-11-06 11:04:11	joacim	not every volume is mounted through fstab either. i dont think the current system needs to change
2018-11-06 11:10:58	joacim	the current lvm.conf that scans all of /dev is also from upstream. there is no specific crux config

2018-11-06 20:08:40	pedja	run vulkaninfo as a sanity check
2018-11-06 20:09:36	ronin7z	i need to install that first 
2018-11-06 20:09:44	ronin7z	is it in vulkantools? 
2018-11-06 20:09:50	pedja	yup
2018-11-06 20:10:08	ronin7z	might it matter that im on kernel 4.14 still

2018-11-06 20:19:05	ronin7z	maybe if slop etc werent broken as well 
2018-11-06 20:19:10	pedja	how can you tell?

2018-11-06 20:19:53	ronin7z	ye like 4 days ago i was using crux, then switched back to void and now switched back to crux again 
2018-11-06 20:20:11	ronin7z	last time on crux i had the same issue and i just tinkered around and it fixed itself but i forgot what i exactly did

2018-11-06 20:23:01	ronin7z	https://paste.pound-python.org/show/xFR4y133NQsufz5d30Jw/
2018-11-06 20:23:03	ronin7z	this is :) 
2018-11-06 20:25:00	pedja	nothing wrong there, afaict. install vulkan-tools-32, and try vulkaninfo-32. you are using 32bit wine, right?
2018-11-06 20:25:25	ronin7z	nope 64bit 
2018-11-06 20:26:11	ronin7z	is there a command to rebuild all my installed packages? 
2018-11-06 20:27:08	pedja	did you rebuild the ones shown in revdep output?
2018-11-06 20:27:15	ronin7z	yupp

2018-11-06 20:27:46	ronin7z	not sure what that does 
2018-11-06 20:28:47	ronin7z	keyutils fails to update for some reason 
2018-11-06 20:42:50	ronin7z	fatal error : profile.h no such file or directory 
2018-11-06 21:10:32	pedja	heh. libvirt now builds with the previous version installed on a system, but it is broken because it still links to some libs from it
2018-11-06 21:33:30	ronin7z	pedja: joacim thanks for the help , i managed to fix it :) 
2018-11-06 21:33:41	joacim	nice =)

2018-11-08 15:29:51	pedja	SiFuh, I had no idea there is such a thing as 'slide rule' collector :). cool, I guess
2018-11-08 15:31:46	SiFuh	Yeah, I was telling the Slackware guys that the existence of a slide rule was only brought to my attention for about 5 minutes and never learned how to use one. I have always been curious and now that I have one in my possession I am wishing I had a manual for.
2018-11-08 15:32:28	SiFuh	That site you sent me is huge!
2018-11-08 15:32:39	pedja	wouldn't books about the general use at least get you started?
2018-11-08 15:33:08	pedja	they can't be *that* different
2018-11-08 15:34:02	SiFuh	I already figured out multiplication and division. But no, there are lots of differences and even more advanced calculations
2018-11-08 15:37:32	pedja	think I saw a friend using it once. seemed...complicated
2018-11-08 15:37:52	SiFuh	http://www.oughtred.org/books/OSSlideRuleReferenceManualrevA.pdf
2018-11-08 15:38:14	SiFuh	I was reading this document about them
2018-11-08 15:38:16	mayfrost	frinnst: I do tethering on another computer usually
2018-11-08 15:38:33	mayfrost	but I see the problem might be on kernel configuration
2018-11-08 15:44:01	pedja	SiFuh, well, fuck :) now I have to find where mine is stashed to play with it
2018-11-08 15:49:47	pedja	I think it's this one http://www.sliderule.ca/staedtler-54428-front.jpg
2018-11-08 15:52:36	pedja	I guess this is the one you have? http://sliderulemuseum.com/Nestler/S477_AlbertNestlerA-G_No9.jpg
2018-11-08 15:53:13	SiFuh	I have this one http://www.sliderulemuseum.com/Nestler/S477_AlbertNestlerA-G_No9.jpg
2018-11-08 15:55:26	SiFuh	The second, third, fourth and fifth row I understand.  First and Sixth row I haven't looked into yet and the otherside of the centre piece that has Sin and Tan and angles I haven't looked at yet.
2018-11-08 15:55:56	SiFuh	The underneath is just a ruler
2018-11-08 15:57:09	pedja	pretty ingenious piece of tech
2018-11-08 15:57:57	john_cephalopoda	Reminds me of sliding calipers. Those are incredible.
2018-11-08 15:58:17	john_cephalopoda	Although they are pretty simple, you can read distances extremely exact.

2018-11-08 15:59:39	pedja	staedtler, faber castell. it's been decades since I last heard those names
2018-11-08 16:00:13	john_cephalopoda	They are both German, aren't they?
2018-11-08 16:00:49	SiFuh	I have a g-clamp micrometer that i got from Grandfather. I think it is genius tech as well.
2018-11-08 16:01:22	john_cephalopoda	All my erasers are from Staedtler. And I still got a lot of Faber Castell color pencils. Used those at school.
2018-11-08 16:02:28	john_cephalopoda	I even got a special edition eraser from Staedtler, which I bought in Italy :þ
2018-11-08 16:02:30	SiFuh	Looks something like this  https://shop.mitutoyo.co.uk/pim/upload/mitutoyoData/image/bigweb/115-215_z_eps.png
2018-11-08 16:03:52	john_cephalopoda	I first used a sliding caliper when I had to cut out some mounting board for an electronic assembly during an internship. Not sure what I even did with it, but it was fun.
2018-11-08 16:05:42	pedja	ah. we had something similar in the machine shop I used to work ages ago
2018-11-08 16:06:19	SiFuh	john_cephalopoda: oh yeah, they are awesome. I was even thinking about getting one today but then I remembered that my friend bought one and it rusted. I was then thinking where I could buy one that would not rust since Australia is full of cheap junk these days.
2018-11-08 16:06:59	SiFuh	john_cephalopoda: these days I still use the G-Clamp style one from my grandfather and convert the inches over to metric.
2018-11-08 16:07:03	john_cephalopoda	I really enjoyed making that mounting board. It was actually not really required from me, but the people there just let me try out what I had fun with, showed me the machines and let me cut the board.
2018-11-08 16:07:08	@jaeger	restoring the rusted one might be an interesting project
2018-11-08 16:08:28	john_cephalopoda	SiFuh: My brother is an industrial mechanic. He said that those sliding calipers are kinda outdated and I should get a digital one if I wanted one. Not sure if he was trolling me or if he was being serious though.
2018-11-08 16:08:43	pedja	can Firefox be considered rusted, since it's using rust for some parts?
2018-11-08 16:08:46	john_cephalopoda	(Digital -> also sliding caliper but with a digital display)
2018-11-08 16:09:16	john_cephalopoda	pedja: Good question. And will Rust go away when you load the WD-40 website?
2018-11-08 16:10:04	SiFuh	My Uncle had a rusted bowie knife. I heated it up in the fire until it was glowing red. I then quickly cooled the tip and slowly cooled the blade. It turned out the blue in colour when I was finished and after I sharpened it my Uncle saw it and was imporessed. He still carries it to this day with him.

2018-11-12 11:06:17	Ergo-	https://bpaste.net/show/0f620e15c88e anyone who has a clue while the build of nodejs is failing? 
2018-11-12 11:09:02	pedja	Ergo-, there is a nodejs port in opt
2018-11-12 11:09:38	Ergo-	pedja: i am aware but that comes without nodejs
2018-11-12 11:09:43	Ergo-	i mean without npm 
2018-11-12 11:09:56	Ergo-	so i wanted to try this one, guess i will just edit the port for npm
2018-11-12 11:11:03	pedja	just remove '--without-npm' from it
2018-11-12 11:11:07	@frinnst	pedja: yeah i liked s01
2018-11-12 11:11:33	pedja	great :) added to the playlist. thanks
2018-11-12 11:13:35	pedja	Romster, why are you disabling npm in nodejs port, anyway?
2018-11-12 11:14:01	Ergo-	i just copied it over to my own repo and removed the flag 
2018-11-12 11:14:55	pedja	yup, that's what I did, too. nodejs is kind of useless for me without npm
2018-11-12 11:15:27	Ergo-	where is the pedja ports repo on the site hmmm 
2018-11-12 11:15:51	pedja	portdb? never applied to it
2018-11-12 11:16:54	pedja	majority of my ports is useless crap no one but me is interested in, anyway :)
2018-11-12 11:17:13	Ergo-	loll
