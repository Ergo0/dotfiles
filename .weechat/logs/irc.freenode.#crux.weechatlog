2018-11-05 23:26:56	ronin7z	or should i make em from scratch 
2018-11-05 23:38:12	Anselmo	they're still up I think, on the github page for 6c37
2018-11-05 23:39:22	ronin7z	the github page gives me a 404 unfortunately 
2018-11-05 23:41:05	Anselmo	https://github.com/6c37/crux-ports ?

2018-11-06 10:57:46	Necrosporus	This is from /etc/rc
2018-11-06 10:58:25	Necrosporus	May I suggest to change the condition to checking if there LVM volumes in fstab maybe?
2018-11-06 10:59:14	Necrosporus	I have LVM installed because I want to mount external HDD occasionally but I don't use LVM for the system
2018-11-06 10:59:58	joacim	which drives have and don't have lvm wouldn't show in fstab. you mount the volume, not the underlying drive.
2018-11-06 11:00:57	Necrosporus	joacim, if fstab has something like /dev/mapper then it's likely LVM, if it has /dev/sda1 then it is not
2018-11-06 11:03:23	joacim	i am aware
2018-11-06 11:04:11	joacim	not every volume is mounted through fstab either. i dont think the current system needs to change
2018-11-06 11:10:58	joacim	the current lvm.conf that scans all of /dev is also from upstream. there is no specific crux config

2018-11-06 20:08:40	pedja	run vulkaninfo as a sanity check
2018-11-06 20:09:36	ronin7z	i need to install that first 
2018-11-06 20:09:44	ronin7z	is it in vulkantools? 
2018-11-06 20:09:50	pedja	yup
2018-11-06 20:10:08	ronin7z	might it matter that im on kernel 4.14 still

2018-11-06 20:23:01	ronin7z	https://paste.pound-python.org/show/xFR4y133NQsufz5d30Jw/
2018-11-06 20:23:03	ronin7z	this is :) 
2018-11-06 20:25:00	pedja	nothing wrong there, afaict. install vulkan-tools-32, and try vulkaninfo-32. you are using 32bit wine, right?
2018-11-06 20:25:25	ronin7z	nope 64bit 
2018-11-06 20:26:11	ronin7z	is there a command to rebuild all my installed packages?

2018-11-06 20:42:50	ronin7z	fatal error : profile.h no such file or directory 
2018-11-06 21:10:32	pedja	heh. libvirt now builds with the previous version installed on a system, but it is broken because it still links to some libs from it
2018-11-06 21:33:30	ronin7z	pedja: joacim thanks for the help , i managed to fix it :) 
2018-11-06 21:33:41	joacim	nice =)

2018-11-08 15:29:51	pedja	SiFuh, I had no idea there is such a thing as 'slide rule' collector :). cool, I guess
2018-11-08 15:31:46	SiFuh	Yeah, I was telling the Slackware guys that the existence of a slide rule was only brought to my attention for about 5 minutes and never learned how to use one. I have always been curious and now that I have one in my possession I am wishing I had a manual for.
2018-11-08 15:32:28	SiFuh	That site you sent me is huge!
2018-11-08 15:32:39	pedja	wouldn't books about the general use at least get you started?
2018-11-08 15:33:08	pedja	they can't be *that* different
2018-11-08 15:34:02	SiFuh	I already figured out multiplication and division. But no, there are lots of differences and even more advanced calculations
2018-11-08 15:37:32	pedja	think I saw a friend using it once. seemed...complicated
2018-11-08 15:37:52	SiFuh	http://www.oughtred.org/books/OSSlideRuleReferenceManualrevA.pdf
2018-11-08 15:38:14	SiFuh	I was reading this document about them
2018-11-08 15:38:16	mayfrost	frinnst: I do tethering on another computer usually
2018-11-08 15:38:33	mayfrost	but I see the problem might be on kernel configuration
2018-11-08 15:44:01	pedja	SiFuh, well, fuck :) now I have to find where mine is stashed to play with it
2018-11-08 15:49:47	pedja	I think it's this one http://www.sliderule.ca/staedtler-54428-front.jpg
2018-11-08 15:52:36	pedja	I guess this is the one you have? http://sliderulemuseum.com/Nestler/S477_AlbertNestlerA-G_No9.jpg
2018-11-08 15:53:13	SiFuh	I have this one http://www.sliderulemuseum.com/Nestler/S477_AlbertNestlerA-G_No9.jpg
2018-11-08 15:55:26	SiFuh	The second, third, fourth and fifth row I understand.  First and Sixth row I haven't looked into yet and the otherside of the centre piece that has Sin and Tan and angles I haven't looked at yet.
2018-11-08 15:55:56	SiFuh	The underneath is just a ruler
2018-11-08 15:57:09	pedja	pretty ingenious piece of tech
2018-11-08 15:57:57	john_cephalopoda	Reminds me of sliding calipers. Those are incredible.
2018-11-08 15:58:17	john_cephalopoda	Although they are pretty simple, you can read distances extremely exact.

2018-11-08 15:59:39	pedja	staedtler, faber castell. it's been decades since I last heard those names
2018-11-08 16:00:13	john_cephalopoda	They are both German, aren't they?
2018-11-08 16:00:49	SiFuh	I have a g-clamp micrometer that i got from Grandfather. I think it is genius tech as well.
2018-11-08 16:01:22	john_cephalopoda	All my erasers are from Staedtler. And I still got a lot of Faber Castell color pencils. Used those at school.
2018-11-08 16:02:28	john_cephalopoda	I even got a special edition eraser from Staedtler, which I bought in Italy :þ
2018-11-08 16:02:30	SiFuh	Looks something like this  https://shop.mitutoyo.co.uk/pim/upload/mitutoyoData/image/bigweb/115-215_z_eps.png
2018-11-08 16:03:52	john_cephalopoda	I first used a sliding caliper when I had to cut out some mounting board for an electronic assembly during an internship. Not sure what I even did with it, but it was fun.
2018-11-08 16:05:42	pedja	ah. we had something similar in the machine shop I used to work ages ago
2018-11-08 16:06:19	SiFuh	john_cephalopoda: oh yeah, they are awesome. I was even thinking about getting one today but then I remembered that my friend bought one and it rusted. I was then thinking where I could buy one that would not rust since Australia is full of cheap junk these days.
2018-11-08 16:06:59	SiFuh	john_cephalopoda: these days I still use the G-Clamp style one from my grandfather and convert the inches over to metric.
2018-11-08 16:07:03	john_cephalopoda	I really enjoyed making that mounting board. It was actually not really required from me, but the people there just let me try out what I had fun with, showed me the machines and let me cut the board.
2018-11-08 16:07:08	@jaeger	restoring the rusted one might be an interesting project
2018-11-08 16:08:28	john_cephalopoda	SiFuh: My brother is an industrial mechanic. He said that those sliding calipers are kinda outdated and I should get a digital one if I wanted one. Not sure if he was trolling me or if he was being serious though.
2018-11-08 16:08:43	pedja	can Firefox be considered rusted, since it's using rust for some parts?
2018-11-08 16:08:46	john_cephalopoda	(Digital -> also sliding caliper but with a digital display)
2018-11-08 16:09:16	john_cephalopoda	pedja: Good question. And will Rust go away when you load the WD-40 website?
2018-11-08 16:10:04	SiFuh	My Uncle had a rusted bowie knife. I heated it up in the fire until it was glowing red. I then quickly cooled the tip and slowly cooled the blade. It turned out the blue in colour when I was finished and after I sharpened it my Uncle saw it and was imporessed. He still carries it to this day with him.

2018-11-12 11:06:17	Ergo-	https://bpaste.net/show/0f620e15c88e anyone who has a clue while the build of nodejs is failing? 
2018-11-12 11:09:02	pedja	Ergo-, there is a nodejs port in opt
2018-11-12 11:09:38	Ergo-	pedja: i am aware but that comes without nodejs
2018-11-12 11:09:43	Ergo-	i mean without npm 
2018-11-12 11:09:56	Ergo-	so i wanted to try this one, guess i will just edit the port for npm
2018-11-12 11:11:03	pedja	just remove '--without-npm' from it
2018-11-12 11:11:07	@frinnst	pedja: yeah i liked s01
2018-11-12 11:11:33	pedja	great :) added to the playlist. thanks
2018-11-12 11:13:35	pedja	Romster, why are you disabling npm in nodejs port, anyway?
2018-11-12 11:14:01	Ergo-	i just copied it over to my own repo and removed the flag 
2018-11-12 11:14:55	pedja	yup, that's what I did, too. nodejs is kind of useless for me without npm
2018-11-12 11:15:27	Ergo-	where is the pedja ports repo on the site hmmm 
2018-11-12 11:15:51	pedja	portdb? never applied to it
2018-11-12 11:16:54	pedja	majority of my ports is useless crap no one but me is interested in, anyway :)
2018-11-12 11:17:13	Ergo-	loll 
2018-11-12 11:17:19	Ergo-	can i have a peek 
2018-11-12 11:17:21	Ergo-	im curious now 
2018-11-12 12:59:40	Ergo-	hmm i added this to my repo https://bpaste.net/show/ef7c89e987fe
2018-11-12 12:59:50	Ergo-	but it still pushes the .tar.gz files

2018-11-12 19:20:20	@jaeger	hrmm, haven't seen that one. I think it should work with 4.14.40, though
2018-11-12 19:23:47	@jaeger	I don't see it on a system with 4.14.71
2018-11-12 19:29:04	Ergo0	yee, i assume its a kernel thing
2018-11-12 19:29:15	Ergo0	maybe a forgotten module, but then again nvidia prop isnt even a option when compiling it right
2018-11-12 19:30:00	Anselmo	you might need to specify things to make the nvidia stuff happy later
2018-11-12 19:30:04	@jaeger	yeah, no proprietary nvidia stuff in the kernel
2018-11-12 19:30:10	Anselmo	but its not something I know much about,
2018-11-12 19:30:17	@frinnst	Ergo0: you'll need to fix httpup for your repo
2018-11-12 19:30:23	Anselmo	I feel like the gentoo wiki probably has a good walkthrough of some of this stuff
2018-11-12 19:31:02	joacim	yeah i tend to go to the gentoo wiki when im looking for certain kernel configs for certain stuff

2018-11-12 19:31:23	Ergo0	i can try and setup httpup tho

2018-11-12 20:24:59	Ergo0	i think this is what is recommended on the crux wiki tho for setting up nvidia with optimus
2018-11-12 20:25:31	@frinnst	is it still needed?

2018-11-12 20:43:24	ryuo	Ergo0: i doubt it's due to your build environment. that kind of errors means either a header isn't being included or the symbol was removed.
2018-11-12 20:46:30	ryuo	Ergo0: what's your kernel version?
2018-11-12 20:46:34	Ergo0	4.19.1
2018-11-12 20:46:55	Ergo0	latest stable
2018-11-12 20:47:10	Ergo0	i will try a later version of the package

2018-11-12 20:51:49	Ergo0	thats my kernel config
2018-11-12 20:51:57	ryuo	Ergo0: doubt it. it should be in your kernel headers.
2018-11-12 20:52:37	Ergo0	 anyway for me to double check?
2018-11-12 20:52:43	ryuo	Not unless you know C.
2018-11-12 20:52:52	Ergo0	i dont know coding lol
2018-11-12 20:53:02	ryuo	Exactly.
2018-11-12 20:53:07	ryuo	But I do.
2018-11-12 20:53:38	ryuo	Hm. Seems this macro/inline function is being used in kernel still.
2018-11-12 20:53:48	ryuo	So why is bbswitch having this compile error?
2018-11-12 20:54:00	Ergo0	i dont think its bbswitch
2018-11-12 20:54:13	Ergo0	since its not a depend on Romster 's bumblebee port
2018-11-12 20:54:47	Ergo0	oh well now that I tagged you, there seems to be a problem with your port regarding the source for virtualGL, seems like they changed the download tree or whatevery ou would call it
2018-11-12 20:55:45	ryuo	I don't maintain any CRUX ports. I just happen to know how to patch most C code issues.
2018-11-12 20:56:34	ryuo	Seriously? It's that simple?
2018-11-12 20:56:58	Ergo0	ryuo: what? you figured it out?
2018-11-12 20:57:15	ryuo	Probably.
2018-11-12 20:57:29	ryuo	It's the kernel headers. They did some restructuring changes.
2018-11-12 20:57:34	ryuo	Let me give you a patch to try.
2018-11-12 20:59:01	ryuo	http://dpaste.com/1TBMF2C
2018-11-12 20:59:06	ryuo	Ergo0: <
2018-11-12 20:59:25	Ergo0	how uhm would i use that
2018-11-12 20:59:41	ryuo	edit the port to apply the patch.
2018-11-12 20:59:57	Ergo0	the bumblebee port or the bbswitch port?
2018-11-12 21:00:01	ryuo	bbswitch
2018-11-12 21:00:04	Ergo0	i was trying romsters bumblbee port which doesnt include bbswitch
2018-11-12 21:00:07	Ergo0	aye will try
2018-11-12 21:00:25	ryuo	I spent 8 years fixing this kind of crap for Frugalware.
2018-11-12 21:00:45	Ergo0	so i make a .c file in the bbswtich ports dir right
2018-11-12 21:00:52	Ergo0	then make it execute that patch
2018-11-12 21:01:13	ryuo	no, you apply the patch from the source directory before trying to run cmake or w/e.
2018-11-12 21:01:40	ryuo	if it works, you can bug the maintainer to include it.
2018-11-12 21:01:44	pedja	are you talking about bbswitch?
2018-11-12 21:01:48	ryuo	yes.
2018-11-12 21:01:57	pedja	it builds fine on my 4.19.1
2018-11-12 21:02:20	Ergo0	where you using the contrib bumblee port?
2018-11-12 21:02:25	Ergo0	were*
2018-11-12 21:02:45	pedja	no, the source tarball
2018-11-12 21:03:01	Ergo0	from the bbswitch git ?

2018-11-12 21:04:20	Ergo0	same problem compiling from tarball
2018-11-12 21:05:16	ryuo	ok. seems i was mistaken.
2018-11-12 21:05:23	pedja	hm 'cc1: some warnings being treated as errors' <-- I didn't get that
2018-11-12 21:05:25	ryuo	it builds on my ubuntu kernel just fine. 4.15.x
2018-11-12 21:05:27	Ergo0	i may have figured out the issue
2018-11-12 21:05:42	ryuo	Ergo0: it may be your kernel headers are borked then.
2018-11-12 21:05:55	ryuo	I was thinking the kernel's APIs got shuffled around,
2018-11-12 21:06:03	ryuo	Wouldn't be the first time I had to swap includes around.
2018-11-12 21:06:07	Ergo0	 https://paste.pound-python.org/show/Xhj5FtcxnSFqomgVHKiI/
2018-11-12 21:06:18	Ergo0	might be my modprobe.d stuff messing it up
2018-11-12 21:06:38	ryuo	what does modprobe have to do with compile a kernel module?
2018-11-12 21:07:02	Ergo0	because the kernel module for nvidia is currently not loaded
2018-11-12 21:07:12	ryuo	So? I don't even use NVIDIA.
2018-11-12 21:07:17	Ergo0	which might be because of that error
2018-11-12 21:07:18	ryuo	It compiled here.
2018-11-12 21:07:24	Ergo0	I dont know, im just spitballing lol
2018-11-12 21:07:37	ryuo	So, something is up with the kernel headers.

2018-11-12 21:19:23	ergo0	so after doing that i should reboot again
2018-11-12 21:19:26	ergo0	?
2018-11-12 21:19:31	ryuo	or try modprobing nvidia
2018-11-12 21:19:59	ergo0	ah that worked
2018-11-12 21:20:16	ryuo	whether it gets loaded on reboot is another matter.
2018-11-12 21:20:31	pedja	nvidia-modprobe should take care of that
2018-11-12 21:20:50	pedja	emphasis on "should" :)
2018-11-12 21:20:52	ryuo	i would hope so, but it's still something i remember needing to do.
2018-11-12 21:21:09	ryuo	it also depends on how the port was installed.
2018-11-12 21:21:18	pedja	I modprobe nvidia-uvm on every reboot
2018-11-12 21:21:19	ryuo	not everything runs the post install scripts.
2018-11-12 21:21:20	ergo0	i just used prt-get depinst

2018-11-12 21:38:27	ryuo	and most of what I know is generic.
2018-11-12 21:39:42	ergo0	hold up, gonna try something out
2018-11-12 21:39:42	<--	ergo0 (~nathaniel@D9695F7E.cm-25.dynamic.ziggo.nl) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 1.9.1)
2018-11-12 21:40:15	-->	Ergo0 (~nathaniel@D9695F7E.cm-25.dynamic.ziggo.nl) has joined #crux
2018-11-12 21:40:22	ryuo	i've noticed programmers seem to be rare around these parts.
2018-11-12 21:40:33	Ergo0	this distro irc?
2018-11-12 21:40:41	ryuo	Eh, at least for CRUX.
2018-11-12 21:41:14	Ergo0	im a digital media and culture studies dude lol
2018-11-12 21:41:31	Ergo0	lets see if i can close my terminal without disconnecting from irc
2018-11-12 21:41:39	ryuo	...
2018-11-12 21:41:56	Ergo0	that worked
2018-11-12 21:42:00	ryuo	I see.
2018-11-12 21:42:00	Ergo0	nice
2018-11-12 21:42:36	Ergo0	sorry lol
2018-11-12 21:43:23	ryuo	there's one breed of developer that seems to be the most feared.
2018-11-12 21:43:29	Ergo0	which iss?
2018-11-12 21:43:32	ryuo	web developers. just ask frinnst. =p
2018-11-12 21:43:34	-->	pankerini (~pankerini@189.230.162.160) has joined #crux
2018-11-12 21:44:21	ryuo	most of them have no technical background, so hilarity ensues if they try to touch anything IT related.
2018-11-12 21:44:46	Ergo0	im gonna pick up webdev stuff
2018-11-12 21:44:47	Ergo0	seems like fun
2018-11-12 21:46:03	ryuo	I actually have a form of IT experience, so...
2018-11-12 21:46:37	ryuo	currently working on getting my new dedicated server configured.
2018-11-12 21:47:54	Ergo0	i actually dont have any practical reason to be on linux lol
2018-11-12 21:48:11	ryuo	webdev gives you a reason.
2018-11-12 21:48:35	ryuo	Most of what you do takes place on servers. Guess what most of them run?
2018-11-12 21:48:38	Ergo0	i used to do webdev school in uni like 3 years ago
2018-11-12 21:48:52	Ergo0	2 years i guess
2018-11-12 21:48:57	ryuo	Linux.
2018-11-12 21:48:59	Ergo0	but i dropped out to go do digital media and culture studies
2018-11-12 21:49:04	Ergo0	yee i am aware
2018-11-12 21:49:26	Ergo0	main reason for me to switch was open source, free, way more control, ricing and fuck windows updates
2018-11-12 21:49:35	Ergo0	how i ended up on crux, i dont know lol
2018-11-12 21:49:47	ryuo	It sounds like you'd be happier with Linux Mint.
2018-11-12 21:50:17	@jaeger	tried bbswitch on a system with linux 4.19 (though not 4.19.1), still built fine there
2018-11-12 21:50:55	Ergo0	ryuo: nah i tried that
2018-11-12 21:50:59	Ergo0	i really  dont like debian
2018-11-12 21:51:05	Ergo0	tried arch, but i didnt like systemd
2018-11-12 21:51:11	Ergo0	tried void but i didnt like the people in their irc
2018-11-12 21:51:34	ryuo	Sounds like me circa 2008.
2018-11-12 21:52:01	ryuo	I eventually went back to Ubuntu after tiring of channel surfing.
2018-11-12 21:52:11	john_cephalopoda	Ergo0: What's your primary GPU?
2018-11-12 21:52:15	Ergo0	also outside of this problem which i apparently cant solve , crux has been great for me
2018-11-12 21:52:17	john_cephalopoda	Intel Haswell?
2018-11-12 21:52:23	Ergo0	john_cephalopoda: the igpu of my 6500HQ
2018-11-12 21:52:28	Ergo0	skylake
2018-11-12 21:52:42	ryuo	Ergo0: whenever you're due for an upgrade, perhaps AMD would be viable.
2018-11-12 21:52:51	ryuo	I bought a ProBook 455 G5 this year.
2018-11-12 21:52:59	Ergo0	my next laptop is prolly gonna be one without a dgpu
2018-11-12 21:53:06	Ergo0	rather have something thin and light
2018-11-12 21:53:22	ryuo	AMD Ryzen has taken off in that area.
2018-11-12 21:53:23	Ergo0	im prolly gonna buy a used hp elitebook folio or something
2018-11-12 21:53:33	Ergo0	ryuo: as long as it can play overwatch
2018-11-12 21:53:38	Ergo0	that would be super good
2018-11-12 21:53:42	ryuo	I don't game, so I don't know.
2018-11-12 21:53:50	joacim	i mostly just play doom on my laptop
2018-11-12 21:53:52	john_cephalopoda	Ergo0: I've been told that Haswell is pretty good already and the nvidia 3d accelerator won't bring me much advantage at a higher energy usage. So using that is probably not really productive anyway.
2018-11-12 21:54:05	joacim	that kind of game works well enough with the trackpoint =)
2018-11-12 21:54:32	ryuo	joacim: heh. the HP elitebooks with AMD Ryzen already launched.
2018-11-12 21:54:45	Ergo0	lolll, i dont think my igpu will be able to play OW
2018-11-12 21:54:55	Ergo0	i could play it on my 960m just fine tho
2018-11-12 21:54:56	@jaeger	From the lspci output you pasted earlier your system looks similar to the laptop I'm using
2018-11-12 21:55:04	@jaeger	intel igpu, nvidia 3d controller
2018-11-12 21:55:26	Ergo0	i have no clue waht is going on
2018-11-12 21:55:26	@jaeger	It all works well for me, for what that's worth
2018-11-12 21:55:30	Ergo0	is there something i can use to fix my kernel headers?
2018-11-12 21:55:43	ryuo	No idea. I'd say nuke it from orbit to be sure.
2018-11-12 21:57:09	ryuo	Ergo0: people generally swear by thinkpads as being the best Linux laptop.
2018-11-12 21:57:30	Ergo0	fuck thinkpads
2018-11-12 21:57:33	Ergo0	they look ugl
2018-11-12 21:57:35	Ergo0	y
2018-11-12 21:57:52	Ergo0	dont ban me
2018-11-12 21:58:22	ryuo	yea... they always prioritized functionality...
2018-11-12 21:58:30	ryuo	X200 was pretty damn good for its time.
2018-11-12 21:59:42	@jaeger	I used an x220 for a few years, it was rock solid
2018-11-12 22:00:10	ryuo	I still have an X200 but I only use it for portable jobs around the house now.
2018-11-12 22:00:23	ryuo	Meltdown pretty much ruined it for anything else.
2018-11-12 22:00:39	ryuo	It's too old to receive updates.
2018-11-12 22:01:02	Ergo0	what the
2018-11-12 22:01:05	ryuo	?
2018-11-12 22:01:08	Ergo0	ryzen laptops are super cheap
2018-11-12 22:01:16	ryuo	Define cheap.
2018-11-12 22:01:33	Ergo0	cheap compared to their nvidia counterparts unless im getting the specs wrong
2018-11-12 22:01:55	ryuo	AMD Ryzen is a significant upgrade compared to previous AMD cpus.
2018-11-12 22:02:17	ryuo	I was following the models for awhile.
2018-11-12 22:02:39	ryuo	What are you looking for?
2018-11-12 22:03:01	ryuo	Gigabit ethernet was a feature that eliminated most of them from my list.
2018-11-12 22:04:15	joacim	i'll be keeping my t420 for a while longer, unless a potential job decides i should get a new laptop
2018-11-12 22:04:19	Ergo0	only thing i want is be able to play OW at like 60fps
2018-11-12 22:04:19	ryuo	I frankly consider Dell, Lenovo, and HP business hardware to be the best choice for longterm use.
2018-11-12 22:04:37	ryuo	Ergo0: there's an ASUS ROG with a desktop Ryzen.
2018-11-12 22:04:42	Ergo0	nahhh fuck that
2018-11-12 22:04:47	ryuo	It's 8 cores.
2018-11-12 22:04:50	Ergo0	also thin and light
2018-11-12 22:05:02	ryuo	Well, it's not light.
2018-11-12 22:05:05	Ergo0	60fps at 720p
2018-11-12 22:05:09	Ergo0	would be fine as well lol
2018-11-12 22:05:34	@jaeger	one thing to consider is there's no support currently for vulkan with optimus so you won't be able to use wine with dxvk for example to play OW
2018-11-12 22:05:48	Ergo0	jaeger: noooooooooooooooo
2018-11-12 22:05:54	Ergo0	all this effort for no reason lol
2018-11-12 22:06:05	ryuo	Ergo0: Linux support for Ryzen is still a WIP.
2018-11-12 22:06:08	@jaeger	Sorry :/ Maybe that'll change in the future
2018-11-12 22:06:19	@jaeger	Ergo0: with that said, it *might* work with wine-pba
2018-11-12 22:06:20	ryuo	You need the latest kernel and such for it to work at all.
2018-11-12 22:06:27	@jaeger	just not dxvk
2018-11-12 22:06:32	Ergo0	ryuo: i would use latest kernel anyways
2018-11-12 22:06:38	Ergo0	its fine, i will just use my igpu to play games
2018-11-12 22:06:40	Ergo0	kappa
2018-11-12 22:07:08	ryuo	i assume you don't care about serviceability.
2018-11-12 22:07:16	@jaeger	I've not tried OW, but WoW works well on this laptop using wine-pba
2018-11-12 22:07:16	ryuo	any brand preferences?
2018-11-12 22:07:30	Ergo0	what gpu you gott
2018-11-12 22:07:33	Ergo0	ryuo: nope not at all
2018-11-12 22:07:38	Ergo0	i have bad experiences with acer tho
2018-11-12 22:07:42	Ergo0	fuck their build quality
2018-11-12 22:07:46	@jaeger	MX150 in this thing... your 960M is more powerful than this one
2018-11-12 22:08:01	Ergo0	well sadly i cant use my 960m yet :(
2018-11-12 22:08:03	ryuo	I had a similar experience with HP consumer. I've been happy with HP business.
2018-11-12 22:08:09	ryuo	That was 10 years ago.
2018-11-12 22:08:24	ryuo	Trouble is business machines are typically boring.
2018-11-12 22:08:31	@jaeger	yeah, but I'm trying to say that if you figure out what's gone wrong on your system, it might work
2018-11-12 22:09:01	Ergo0	jaeger: yee i guess thats true
2018-11-12 22:09:11	Ergo0	i really wonder how i could possiblly fix this tho
2018-11-12 22:09:15	Ergo0	i dont even know waht the cause is
2018-11-12 22:10:25	@jaeger	No idea... hard to guess since I can't reproduce your build error here
2018-11-12 22:10:40	@jaeger	Did you try my bbswitch package?
2018-11-12 22:12:55	@jaeger	also, have you updated everything on your system since installing?
2018-11-12 22:19:53	Ergo0	jaeger: nope not yet
2018-11-12 22:20:01	ryuo	https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/ideapad/ideapad-700-series/Ideapad-720S-13-AMD/p/88IP70S0929
2018-11-12 22:20:03	Ergo0	and everything execpt keyutils and lvm2
2018-11-12 22:20:30	Ergo0	since those for some reason wont update
2018-11-12 22:21:11	ryuo	Ergo0: that the kind of stuff you're looking for?
2018-11-12 22:21:30	Ergo0	i dont see it in your ports repo jaeger
2018-11-12 22:21:41	@jaeger	won't update how?
2018-11-12 22:21:51	Ergo0	i did try the one you send me earlier
2018-11-12 22:21:52	@jaeger	I linked it here earlier
2018-11-12 22:22:05	Ergo0	and it installed as well
2018-11-12 22:22:27	@jaeger	OK, then what?
2018-11-12 22:23:07	Ergo0	its installed
2018-11-12 22:23:22	@jaeger	OK, did you test? :)
2018-11-12 22:23:34	Ergo0	ryuo: that looks great
2018-11-12 22:23:36	Ergo0	jaeger: not yet
2018-11-12 22:23:39	Ergo0	lemme try
2018-11-12 22:24:00	@jaeger	At some point, pastebin your keyutils and lvm2 errors, maybe they're related
2018-11-12 22:24:55	ryuo	Ergo0: if you're going to buy soon, AMD Ryzen is likely the best value at the moment. No idea how it would handle OW though.
2018-11-12 22:25:23	Ergo0	yeee i was about to look into that
2018-11-12 22:25:29	joacim	got a feeling ryuo owns amd stock =)
2018-11-12 22:25:35	Ergo0	both of those things that were said
2018-11-12 22:25:37	ryuo	Plus it's less suspectible to the speculative execution crap.
2018-11-12 22:25:53	Anselmo	just invest in sledgehammers
2018-11-12 22:26:03	Anselmo	so as to smash all the computers at some near date. . .
2018-11-12 22:26:28	Ergo0	jaeger: hmmmm https://paste.pound-python.org/show/1NCZREqEWEbWRnRuzrwL/
2018-11-12 22:26:36	ryuo	Ergo0: http://dpaste.com/00MCA3D :D
2018-11-12 22:26:43	ryuo	Immune to 2 out of 5.
2018-11-12 22:27:03	ryuo	l1tf and meltdown
2018-11-12 22:27:04	Ergo0	that was the wrong one , hold up
2018-11-12 22:27:40	Ergo0	is that goood?
2018-11-12 22:28:35	Anselmo	its better than a lot of intel's stuff . . .
2018-11-12 22:28:41	Anselmo	which is relatively speaking quite good :P
2018-11-12 22:29:09	Ergo0	jaeger: IT WORKSSS
2018-11-12 22:29:25	Ergo0	i installed primus instead of the other thing
2018-11-12 22:29:27	Ergo0	virtualgl
2018-11-12 22:29:53	@jaeger	good, that's some progress at least
2018-11-12 22:30:00	Ergo0	now i just have to compile wine and see lol
2018-11-12 22:30:34	Ergo0	is virtualgl better then primus?
2018-11-12 22:31:36	@jaeger	No idea there, I use primus and it works
2018-11-12 22:31:56	Ergo0	ayee cool
2018-11-12 22:35:36	joacim	i remember people talked about dx12 being able to spread the load across gpus. was that a big fat lie?
2018-11-12 22:37:30	Ergo0	im not sure
2018-11-12 22:37:45	Ergo0	it does seem like vulkan is doing well tho
2018-11-12 22:37:55	pedja	joacim, isn't SLI basically dead?
2018-11-12 22:38:01	Ergo0	and yee i think so as well
2018-11-12 22:38:13	Ergo0	you can still use dual gpu i think but nvidia killed support for sli
2018-11-12 22:38:16	Ergo0	iirc
2018-11-12 22:38:39	joacim	there is support for dual card sli, but i doubt there will be much of a future for it in video games
2018-11-12 22:39:09	pedja	too much work for small percentage of usage
2018-11-12 22:39:16	@jaeger	Yeah, I think SLi is basically gone at this point but NVlink is much better (tm)
2018-11-12 22:39:36	pedja	SLI mk.2 :) ?
2018-11-12 22:39:49	joacim	amd tried to push crossfire with their rx 480
2018-11-12 22:39:54	Ergo0	i wonder how long compiling wine will take on my i5 6600hq
2018-11-12 22:39:55	joacim	but i dont see crossfire used much either
2018-11-12 22:39:58	Ergo0	or whatever my cpu is
2018-11-12 22:40:07	Ergo0	joacim: same, then again dual gpu is kind of a waste
2018-11-12 22:40:14	Ergo0	for gaming atleast
2018-11-12 22:40:31	pedja	amd for graphics, nvidia for cuda compute :)
2018-11-12 22:40:54	pedja	or gpu passthrough
2018-11-12 22:41:21	Ergo0	amd works well for gpu passthrough as well
2018-11-12 22:42:04	pedja	wasn't their an issue with Vega gpu basically freezing, so the only way out was reboot?
2018-11-12 22:42:07	@jaeger	Ergo0: I've no idea how regular wine or wine-staging handle OW, but if you decide to check out PBA, there's a port for it: https://crux.ninja/portdb/port/jaeger/wine-pba/
2018-11-12 22:42:26	Ergo0	jaeger: thankss
2018-11-12 22:42:38	Ergo0	im trying to make my lutris port work
2018-11-12 22:42:46	Ergo0	but it seems like its still missing some stuff
2018-11-12 22:42:58	Ergo0	jaeger: its super great aat using different wines etc
2018-11-12 22:43:02	Ergo0	you should check it out sometime
2018-11-12 22:43:35	@jaeger	I've looked at it. Neat idea but I've not really needed it so far
2018-11-12 22:45:30	pedja	I've tried to use fusion360 with wine. didn't go so well :)
2018-11-12 22:46:43	Ergo0	why does wine-staging need llvm7
2018-11-12 22:46:46	Ergo0	thinking
2018-11-12 22:46:51	Ergo0	pedja: try with dxvk :)
2018-11-12 22:46:55	Ergo0	its magic
2018-11-12 22:47:44	pedja	that was the idea, but it won't install
2018-11-12 22:48:20	pedja	online installer hangs forever
2018-11-12 22:48:26	Ergo0	hmmm thats odd
2018-11-12 22:48:49	Ergo0	https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=15617
2018-11-12 22:48:58	Ergo0	doesnt look to great on winehq
2018-11-12 22:49:29	pedja	yeah. so I installed it on a Win10 laptop, so I can play with it
2018-11-12 22:50:07	pedja	haven't tried yet to rdp to it
2018-11-12 22:50:13	Ergo0	ayee makes sense
2018-11-12 22:53:38	pedja	frinnst, any issues with xrdp and Win10 that you are aware of? or you rdp only to Windows servers?
2018-11-12 22:53:56	Ergo0	well boys, im gonna go back home from my friends place
2018-11-12 22:54:06	Ergo0	going back to my trusty pc with my r9 290

2018-11-12 22:57:35	pedja	VMWorld Europe is in Barcelona. nice
2018-11-12 22:57:57	joacim	https://www.ebay.com/itm/Sapphire-R9-290-Tri-X-OC-4GB-GDDR5-Graphics-Card/192714255841
2018-11-12 22:58:05	joacim	the back of that card looks a bit nasty
2018-11-12 22:58:23	joacim	is that aircon damage?
2018-11-12 22:59:44	@frinnst	pedja: only servers
2018-11-12 22:59:58	@frinnst	but I suspect the issues I had with 2016 are also in win10
2018-11-12 23:00:38	joacim	https://www.ebay.com/itm/Sapphire-Radeon-R9-290X-8GB-GDDR5-Dual-DVI-D-HMDI-DP-TRI-X-OC-Version/352491097902
2018-11-12 23:00:43	joacim	this has some green on it
2018-11-12 23:00:55	pedja	didn't MS introduce a new version of RDP in Win10, or something like that?
2018-11-12 23:01:03	@frinnst	eew
2018-11-12 23:01:10	joacim	i know they introduced a new client
2018-11-12 23:01:43	@frinnst	2016=older win10
2018-11-12 23:03:07	pedja	I wonder what, apart from wifi, will MS update break on that laptop this time, it's been a while
2018-11-12 23:04:16	@frinnst	zip files?
2018-11-12 23:04:38	pedja	what?
2018-11-12 23:06:37	@frinnst	https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-10-1809-zip-extraction-bug-overwrites-files-without-confirmation/
2018-11-12 23:07:05	joacim	if they fix all the bugs
2018-11-12 23:07:14	joacim	will it still be windows?
2018-11-12 23:08:28	pedja	holy shit, that's...kind of hilarious, tbh
2018-11-12 23:09:46	@jaeger	reminds me of EVE Online deleting your boot.ini
2018-11-12 23:10:08	@jaeger	man, that was a long time ago
2018-11-12 23:10:32	joacim	i dont know what they were thinking there
2018-11-12 23:10:37	joacim	didnt happen to me at least
2018-11-12 23:10:57	@jaeger	Undoubtedly they weren't thinking, just a mistake
2018-11-12 23:11:11	@jaeger	Not enough QA testing, etc.
2018-11-12 23:11:37	joacim	they choked their players internet connection once too
2018-11-12 23:11:44	joacim	from including a torrent client in the launcher
2018-11-12 23:12:10	joacim	wasted peoples'data caps
2018-11-12 23:12:58	@jaeger	oops, heh
2018-11-12 23:13:17	pedja	MS, Nvidia and now even AMD are pushing Cloud Gaming. how feasible is that?
2018-11-12 23:13:40	joacim	sounds like the good old days of door games
2018-11-12 23:15:26	pedja	I understand why Nvidia and AMD, they'd love to sell expensive racks of GPUs to DCs. but MS?
2018-11-12 23:15:59	@frinnst	I still dont understand how they will/have solve(d) latency
2018-11-12 23:16:57	pedja	that's another issue. how many people have bandwidth required for something like that?
2018-11-12 23:17:15	@frinnst	pied piper will solve it
2018-11-12 23:20:02	<--	onodera (~onodera@camille.xs4all.nl) has quit (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
2018-11-12 23:21:46	Ergo-	nice 
2018-11-12 23:21:49	Ergo-	back on my trusty pc 
2018-11-12 23:22:20	joacim	pedja: for ms it would be more revenue from azure i guess
2018-11-12 23:22:30	joacim	and licenses for their other technologies
2018-11-12 23:27:37	pedja	that makes sense
2018-11-12 23:28:28	Ergo-	hi
2018-11-12 23:28:38	Ergo-	lol i accidently removed the input bar 
2018-11-12 23:28:44	Ergo-	i meant to hide the thing thats above that 
2018-11-12 23:29:00	abenz	cloud gaming eh?
2018-11-12 23:29:43	abenz	I wonder if the guy who coined this term, cloud, when talking about "put your stuff in our server", knew it would take off like this..
2018-11-12 23:29:51	ryuo	silently overwriting files?
2018-11-12 23:30:11	ryuo	I guess Microsoft wanted to copy that tradition of TAR.
2018-11-12 23:32:41	pedja	interesting take on desktop environment https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vY2B9m5HDM&list=PLGqpKIeZOSp6quf6CmMOr91Tmj4UppyoR&index=2
2018-11-12 23:35:17	pedja	if articles on the site are to be believed, the plan is to reach feature parity with Xorg before 1.0 :)
2018-11-12 23:37:12	pedja	the last time I bothered to check, wayland was still far from that
2018-11-12 23:48:02	joacim	most interesting thing for me is cave story
