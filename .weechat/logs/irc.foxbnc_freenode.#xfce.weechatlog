2018-12-20 21:05:17	diogenes_	EdePopede, what is hanging keys?
2018-12-20 21:17:19	EdePopede	diogenes_: when of 2 keys pressed (<mod>+<action>) one is seen as pressed after releasing it
2018-12-20 21:18:00	EdePopede	i defined some extra hotkeys to swith desktops and such (the list in the config box is nearly full) and i use them extensively

2018-12-20 21:19:12	EdePopede	like win+cursor = switch to neighbour desktop. and then the window in the foreground on the new desktop sees a cursor key constantly being pressed. no matter what program this is.
2018-12-20 21:19:41	diogenes_	EdePopede, has it always been like this/
2018-12-20 21:20:10	EdePopede	like when it is <left>, xterm starts to blink insanely, with <up> mplayer sets volume to max (just had main at 160%)
2018-12-20 21:21:10	EdePopede	diogenes_, good question. since it doesn't happen always. maybe it depends on whatever, maybe it is the order how i release the keys. or how fast the program receiving it gets the focus. no clue.

2018-12-20 21:22:03	EdePopede	it goes on for a while now, maybe it started with the switch to stretch.
2018-12-20 21:23:13	diogenes_	EdePopede, did you preserve all the configs from the previous install? maybe it would make sense to create a new user and see if the issue persists with the new user
2018-12-20 21:23:36	EdePopede	diogenes_: all. and if i say all, i mean all ;)
2018-12-20 21:24:01	EdePopede	actually i saved everything to play it back one by one in a controlled manner
2018-12-20 21:24:31	EdePopede	i would have to log out :o
2018-12-20 21:24:43	EdePopede	ok, there's "switch user"

2018-12-20 22:07:50	EdePopede	uh, the logout dialog really needs a redesign. turned off the other pc, thought it was because of adwaita dark. switch to the normal version, still wasn't able to see which element is active.
2018-12-20 22:08:22	EdePopede	had to nearly press my nose against the monitor to see that maybe 2px wide dotted border in gray on gray...
2018-12-20 22:09:09	EdePopede	i think i'll check out the other themes when i find the time
