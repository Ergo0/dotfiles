2018-12-03 16:30:44	RustyJ	pm okay?
2018-12-03 16:31:26	ronin7z	yee sure 
2018-12-03 16:31:44	RustyJ	sorry some of my advice makes the hardliners freak out
2018-12-03 16:31:57	RustyJ	and it will just confuse you
2018-12-03 16:32:19	RustyJ	where on the globe are you? in reach of amazon?
2018-12-03 16:32:56	ronin7z	whatchu mean the hardliners? 
2018-12-03 16:33:04	ronin7z	im in the netherlands , i can order stuff from amazon.de  
2018-12-03 16:33:11	ronin7z	so that should be fine , unless i wanna go for aliexpress 
2018-12-03 16:33:25	RustyJ	the hardcore purists that believe only QMK boards are worth anything
2018-12-03 16:33:54	RustyJ	you should look at getting a "starter board" before you delve into building one
2018-12-03 16:33:55	ronin7z	qmk? 
2018-12-03 16:34:16	ronin7z	you mean like that guy who said i might as well get a 10 eu membrame keyboard if i want to spend like a 100 bucks 
2018-12-03 16:34:17	RustyJ	it a open source firmware and chipset MCU 
2018-12-03 16:34:28	RustyJ	ya those guys
2018-12-03 16:34:28	ronin7z	ohh lol 
2018-12-03 16:34:33	ronin7z	starter boards hmm 
2018-12-03 16:34:46	ronin7z	tbh if i dont do the soldering and stuff i dont feel like i really build it 
2018-12-03 16:34:53	ronin7z	also arent they more expensive? 
2018-12-03 16:34:57	RustyJ	i recommend a board you can hotswap
2018-12-03 16:34:59	RustyJ	no
2018-12-03 16:35:19	ronin7z	why would you recommend that? 
2018-12-03 16:35:20	RustyJ	so you can still pull keys and change them out and try different things
2018-12-03 16:35:23	ronin7z	ahh sure 
2018-12-03 16:35:29	ronin7z	thats without soldering right? 
2018-12-03 16:35:44	RustyJ	ya it just has a little tool and they pop right out
2018-12-03 16:36:36	RustyJ	now in about 5 jillion hours of research and about that much money i discovered a few things
2018-12-03 16:38:28	RustyJ	this is a good board https://www.amazon.de/Glorious-GMMK-Full-Size-Tastatur-GMMK-BRN/dp/B01D8YNJH0
2018-12-03 16:38:51	RustyJ	however some of found the china OEM that makes the board for them
2018-12-03 16:39:00	RustyJ	us^
2018-12-03 16:39:44	RustyJ	https://www.amazon.de/tecware-Phantom-mechanische-Tastatur-RGB-LED/dp/B079HTZQYV/
2018-12-03 16:40:28	RustyJ	one caveat is it is not QMK compatible, but nothing you don't have to build is or it's 500USD.
2018-12-03 16:41:06	RustyJ	if you buy the techware board the GMMK software works on it out of the box.
2018-12-03 16:43:04	RustyJ	you probably wanna grab some decent PBT keycaps to go with it. i built my son the techware with these inexpensive caps......
2018-12-03 16:43:54	RustyJ	https://www.ebay.com/itm/PBT-Keycaps-Backlit-108-Key-Set-Doubleshot-Translucent-for-Cherry-MX-Key-Caps-US/232698460135
2018-12-03 16:44:19	RustyJ	you can probably find those from ali for your location.
2018-12-03 16:45:20	RustyJ	careful to not buy the backlit caps that have the weird zero that's three parentheses ()). 
2018-12-03 16:45:34	RustyJ	cause the legend STINKS on those.
2018-12-03 16:45:38	ronin7z	woww 
2018-12-03 16:45:40	ronin7z	i went out for a smoke 
2018-12-03 16:45:48	ronin7z	lemme process all this 
2018-12-03 16:45:50	RustyJ	i blew you up, lol
2018-12-03 16:47:11	ronin7z	ayeee 
2018-12-03 16:47:13	ronin7z	hmm lemme see 
2018-12-03 16:47:27	ronin7z	i originally was just gonna get a anne pro or a drevo 
2018-12-03 16:47:32	ronin7z	but then i decided on just building my own 
2018-12-03 16:47:44	RustyJ	this is a middle ground, sort of
2018-12-03 16:48:06	ronin7z	i mean, swapping out switches is just like 
2018-12-03 16:48:13	ronin7z	you ply them out, put in a new switch and done 
2018-12-03 16:48:23	RustyJ	yes
2018-12-03 16:48:44	ronin7z	so its like ,whats the benefit compared to just getting a anne pro or something like that
2018-12-03 16:48:55	ronin7z	cause if you like the switch, you're prolly not gonna swap it anytime soon 
2018-12-03 16:49:31	RustyJ	true i dislike 60% boards
2018-12-03 16:49:43	RustyJ	i like my arrow keys on layer one
2018-12-03 16:49:47	ronin7z	i havent tried them yet 
2018-12-03 16:49:49	RustyJ	and not shared
2018-12-03 16:49:55	ronin7z	but then again i never use my arrow keys at all 
2018-12-03 16:50:05	RustyJ	i use them constantly
2018-12-03 16:50:11	ronin7z	like 60% has basically all the keys that i actually use 
2018-12-03 16:50:34	ronin7z	i like how the vortex poker looks as well 
2018-12-03 16:50:48	RustyJ	anne pro 2 is good board, + it's bluetooth
2018-12-03 16:51:02	ronin7z	yee it is 
2018-12-03 16:51:09	ronin7z	but for some reason, i really wanna try building my own 
2018-12-03 16:51:18	ronin7z	seems like a fun project 
2018-12-03 16:51:19	RustyJ	i see alot of complaints about vortex pk3r.
2018-12-03 16:51:57	ronin7z	like what i got so far was that im getting a satan gh60 pcb 
2018-12-03 16:52:05	ronin7z	since that apparently is a good budget pcb 
2018-12-03 16:52:15	RustyJ	true
2018-12-03 16:53:03	ronin7z	also
2018-12-03 16:53:11	RustyJ	you can buy an assembled board with keycaps/rgb/usbc/and gh60 for 40euro
2018-12-03 16:53:14	ronin7z	i can put arrow keys on layer 1 right 
2018-12-03 16:53:23	RustyJ	yes you can
2018-12-03 16:53:25	ronin7z	cause i never use ralt rshift etc 
2018-12-03 16:53:43	ronin7z	what? where do you buy those lol?

2018-12-03 16:55:39	ronin7z	how the hell do they sell that for 40 
2018-12-03 16:55:41	ronin7z	thats insane 
2018-12-03 16:55:48	RustyJ	i dunno
2018-12-03 16:56:00	RustyJ	cause DIY is a scam?
2018-12-03 16:56:14	ronin7z	lol 
2018-12-03 16:56:16	ronin7z	what do you use? 
2018-12-03 16:56:31	RustyJ	my daily board is......
2018-12-03 16:57:01	RustyJ	https://keeb.io/collections/frontpage/products/quefrency-60-65-split-staggered-keyboard?variant=12204552847454
2018-12-03 16:57:07	RustyJ	the 65% one
2018-12-03 16:57:23	ronin7z	its staggered? 
2018-12-03 16:57:24	RustyJ	and i use a filco tkl
2018-12-03 16:57:39	RustyJ	as opposed to ortho
2018-12-03 16:58:09	RustyJ	yes staggered, normal keyboard... ortho is when they are all in line like....
2018-12-03 16:58:28	RustyJ	https://keeb.io/collections/frontpage/products/dilly-3x10-ortholinear-keyboard-for-kailh-choc-low-profile-switches
2018-12-03 16:58:45	ronin7z	oh loll 
2018-12-03 16:58:57	ronin7z	now do i get a plastic or aluminum case 
2018-12-03 16:59:26	ronin7z	i would get plastic, but all of them have bad reviews 
2018-12-03 17:04:23	RustyJ	plastic.... but i think you can find a alu case to replace it
2018-12-03 17:04:44	RustyJ	you would need to google to make sure the ali alu case fits the gh61
2018-12-03 17:04:50	ronin7z	yeee 
2018-12-03 17:04:52	RustyJ	i never tried that
2018-12-03 17:04:56	ronin7z	also seems like aliexpress is way cheaper 
2018-12-03 17:04:59	ronin7z	then amazon 
2018-12-03 17:05:11	ronin7z	seems like i literally save 30/40 bucks 
2018-12-03 17:05:20	RustyJ	true, you pay with time tho.... sometimes ali takes FOREVER
2018-12-03 17:05:30	ronin7z	i mean my time aint worth 40 bucks 
2018-12-03 17:05:49	RustyJ	and banggood is cashing in so watch prices with them on stuff
2018-12-03 17:05:54	ronin7z	you can even get a pre soldered satan gh60 for 25 dollarts 
2018-12-03 17:06:08	ronin7z	with rgb? 
2018-12-03 17:06:10	ronin7z	how do they do this 
2018-12-03 17:06:16	RustyJ	there is even a hotswap presoldered that pops up
2018-12-03 17:06:52	RustyJ	china? 4 dollars worth of parts and 2 dollars labor?
2018-12-03 17:08:05	ronin7z	i guess thats true 
2018-12-03 17:08:05	ronin7z	still 
2018-12-03 17:09:05	RustyJ	watch which one you get tho, some of them are optical/mechanical switches
2018-12-03 17:09:26	RustyJ	which are weirdo light saber technology
2018-12-03 17:10:17	ronin7z	ohh, i wasnt planning on getting those 
2018-12-03 17:10:42	RustyJ	one project i'm working on... at least in theroy
2018-12-03 17:11:02	ronin7z	well this will have to wait anyways 
2018-12-03 17:11:05	RustyJ	is a magicforce with a custom pcb
2018-12-03 17:11:09	ronin7z	first things first, finish building my pc 
2018-12-03 17:11:20	ronin7z	i recentyl sold my old motherboard, cpu and memory 
2018-12-03 17:11:25	RustyJ	thats a inexpensive fun board to build
2018-12-03 17:11:27	ronin7z	got a new motherboard, just gotta orde the cpu 
2018-12-03 17:11:47	RustyJ	nice, work just bought me a new home machine with end of the year money
2018-12-03 17:11:58	ronin7z	yee thats neat 
2018-12-03 17:12:11	RustyJ	so look at this project.......
2018-12-03 17:12:12	ronin7z	i figured this was like the last time i could sell my 6700k set 
2018-12-03 17:12:31	ronin7z	so i went and made the switch to amd, got the asus crosshair vi hero for like 120 bucks 
2018-12-03 17:12:51	ronin7z	was 250 at launch and being a x370 chipset it still retails for 200 
2018-12-03 17:13:07	RustyJ	nice!!!
2018-12-03 17:13:19	RustyJ	this board https://www.amazon.de/Mechanische-Tastatur-Brauner-Schalter-Verdrahtet/dp/B01EJ7ZHQG
2018-12-03 17:13:42	ronin7z	yee i was looking at that 
2018-12-03 17:13:47	ronin7z	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mokFMi1LOZI
2018-12-03 17:13:49	ronin7z	watching this now 
2018-12-03 17:14:16	RustyJ	https://spacecat.design/products/mf68-v1-1-pcb <---- then solder this pcb in
2018-12-03 17:14:27	RustyJ	and switch out the keycaps
2018-12-03 17:14:41	ronin7z	damnn thats nice
2018-12-03 17:14:44	ronin7z	but wh ygo that route 
2018-12-03 17:14:50	ronin7z	over just getting everything new? 
2018-12-03 17:14:57	RustyJ	inexpensive QMK board
2018-12-03 17:14:57	ronin7z	or is it like waaaaaaaaaaay cheaper like this 
2018-12-03 17:15:04	RustyJ	way way cheaper
2018-12-03 17:15:10	ronin7z	this will run you about what
2018-12-03 17:15:12	ronin7z	130 in total? 
2018-12-03 17:15:51	RustyJ	nah.... board is 38, pcb and brain is 20, and keycaps are 25
2018-12-03 17:15:58	ronin7z	oh right 
2018-12-03 17:16:11	ronin7z	you can just get the cheapest magicforce keyboard
2018-12-03 17:16:15	RustyJ	i'll wait till i find a used one on ebay for 20 bucks
2018-12-03 17:16:16	ronin7z	cause your gonna take everything out anyways 
2018-12-03 17:17:43	ronin7z	i could actually just get a magicforce keyboard
2018-12-03 17:17:54	ronin7z	and then swap out the pcb and switches etc later 
2018-12-03 17:19:02	RustyJ	ya
2018-12-03 17:19:14	RustyJ	got get some desoldering skills tho
2018-12-03 17:19:20	ronin7z	oh right 
2018-12-03 17:19:26	ronin7z	guess thats something for later lol 
2018-12-03 17:23:03	RustyJ	actually you could just buy new switches
2018-12-03 17:23:20	RustyJ	and throw away the old PCB with the switches still in it
2018-12-03 17:23:41	ronin7z	loll yee 
2018-12-03 17:25:18	RustyJ	gateron switches can be had from china 10 for 2USD
2018-12-03 17:28:34	RustyJ	the elitist keyboard prices and attitude tends to be a barrier to the hobby, and it's all hype. 
2018-12-03 17:28:59	ronin7z	are gateron switches any good? 
2018-12-03 17:29:21	RustyJ	IMHO better than cherry
2018-12-03 17:30:01	RustyJ	alps>gateron>outemu>cherry
2018-12-03 17:30:26	RustyJ	alps aren't mx compatible and are pretty expensive
2018-12-03 17:30:45	ronin7z	what about kaihl switches? 
2018-12-03 17:30:59	ronin7z	also what gaterons are cherry brown-ish 
2018-12-03 17:31:18	RustyJ	i think they are scratchy, other people say they are the best
2018-12-03 17:32:06	RustyJ	gateron brown are dead ringers for cherry, no click, 45/50 gram activation, tactile bump
2018-12-03 17:37:01	ronin7z	hmmm 
2018-12-03 17:37:12	ronin7z	honestly, i just want tactile not too loud switches 
2018-12-03 17:37:26	ronin7z	a slight click would be allright too 
2018-12-03 17:37:56	RustyJ	browns
2018-12-03 17:38:52	RustyJ	you watch jay's switch review?
