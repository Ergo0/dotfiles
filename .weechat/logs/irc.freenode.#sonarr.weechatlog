2018-12-12 17:38:52	fryfrog	ergo0: Avoid 777, it means you don't know what is going on :(
2018-12-12 17:39:05	fryfrog	ergo0: what user/group does sonarr run as?
2018-12-12 17:39:16	+xelra	Hey, that's my supportee. ;P
2018-12-12 17:39:24	fryfrog	Too slow :p
2018-12-12 17:39:34	ergo0	lol 
2018-12-12 17:39:42	ergo0	sonarr runs under uid 974 
2018-12-12 17:39:51	ergo0	my userid is 1000 
2018-12-12 17:40:00	fryfrog	Does each daemon have its own user?
2018-12-12 17:40:01	ergo0	https://forum.manjaro.org/t/how-to-correctly-install-sonarr-without-file-permission-issues/54451/4 was about to follow this 
2018-12-12 17:40:13	ergo0	uhmmm i just started them by systemctl start sonarr 
2018-12-12 17:40:22	+xelra	A good idea is always to su to the user that sonarr runs at. Then try chmod and see what happens.
2018-12-12 17:40:33	ergo0	the drive in question is just a folder for games and media 
2018-12-12 17:40:40	ergo0	so like i wouldnt mind opening it up to everything 
2018-12-12 17:40:46	+xelra	You might need to change the shell entry in /etc/passwd for that.
2018-12-12 17:40:50	fryfrog	ergo0: You can `systemctl cat sonarr` to see what user it runs as
2018-12-12 17:41:00	fryfrog	And group.
2018-12-12 17:41:27	fryfrog	But TL;DR is that you want a user per daemon and a shared group, using a umask of 002 which is 775 for folders and 664 for files.
2018-12-12 17:41:36	ergo0	this is hte output https://paste.pound-python.org/show/HyDUGCUyigBf5vpH1ZRk/
2018-12-12 17:41:41	+xelra	Once it works as the user in question, I suggest creating a group called `media` and then running plex, sonarr, radarr, all with that group.
2018-12-12 17:42:07	+xelra	Then you just need 660 for files and 770 for directories.
2018-12-12 17:42:17	ergo0	damn , i know my way around linux somewhat 
2018-12-12 17:42:22	ergo0	but im so bad with perms lol 
2018-12-12 17:42:31	ergo0	setting up a gpu passthrough vm is much easier lol 
2018-12-12 17:42:36	fryfrog	Do you know where the numbers come from? I think knowing that helps a lot.
2018-12-12 17:42:46	+xelra	Well, take your time. We're not going anywhere.
2018-12-12 17:43:19	ergo0	cant i just add sonarr to my user groups? 
2018-12-12 17:43:23	+xelra	If you have permissions with 3 octets, the first is user, the second is group and the third is everyone.
2018-12-12 17:43:30	+xelra	6 means read+write.
2018-12-12 17:43:30	fryfrog	ergo0: that works too
2018-12-12 17:43:37	+xelra	7 means read+write+execute.
2018-12-12 17:43:45	ergo0	that would be like usermod -a -G sonarr ronin 
2018-12-12 17:43:47	ergo0	right? 
2018-12-12 17:43:48	fryfrog	ergo0: but your sonarr is running as sonarr:sonarr, so you'd just need to flip it.
2018-12-12 17:44:03	fryfrog	ergo0: but if you're going to do this work, you may as well add a new group
2018-12-12 17:44:08	fryfrog	and just add your user to that group.
2018-12-12 17:44:14	+xelra	Yes, it's not advisable.
2018-12-12 17:44:20	+xelra	It's more work than the other way around.

2018-12-12 17:45:39	ergo0	i solved it 
2018-12-12 17:45:41	ergo0	i just went into su 
2018-12-12 17:45:47	ergo0	did usermod -a -G sonarr ronin 
2018-12-12 17:45:50	ergo0	and now it works 
2018-12-12 17:46:40	-->	Lenovoi5 (~quassel@unaffiliated/lenovoi5) has joined #sonarr
2018-12-12 17:46:47	ergo0	that prolly wasnt the most secure way of fixing it i guess 
2018-12-12 17:47:00	+xelra	Yeah, that just means that where you have your library is only accessible by the group ronin.
2018-12-12 17:47:24	fryfrog	Also, your files are still 777 probably :)
2018-12-12 17:47:31	+xelra	The better way would me to make a media group and then add ronin, plex, radarr and sonarr to it.
2018-12-12 17:47:35	ergo0	i mean if it works it works, right :) 
2018-12-12 17:47:39	fryfrog	My guess is that some file or folder in the path was *not* 777
2018-12-12 17:47:54	ergo0	i used chown 777 on the whole drive 
2018-12-12 17:48:03	ergo0	i could try adding a media grooup later 
2018-12-12 17:48:06	+xelra	*cringe*.
2018-12-12 17:48:18	fryfrog	ergo0: depends on your goal, chances are good that since you're setting up poorly now, you'll run into issues later.
2018-12-12 17:48:18	+xelra	Well, if it's nothing important on there.
2018-12-12 17:48:28	ergo0	yee its just games and media 
2018-12-12 17:48:37	fryfrog	But you can always just figure it out then :)
2018-12-12 17:49:17	fryfrog	https://old.reddit.com/r/usenet/wiki/docker <- ignore the parts about docker, but there is a short section about permissions that might help you understand
2018-12-12 17:49:35	ergo0	fryfrog: yeee, thanks for pointing me in the right direction 
2018-12-12 17:49:44	ergo0	xelra: as well
2018-12-12 17:49:49	ergo0	i will fix this sometime 
2018-12-12 17:49:51	ergo0	promise 
2018-12-12 17:49:58	fryfrog	:)
2018-12-12 17:50:23	+xelra	If you need to chang permissions of your library later, you can do it with find.
2018-12-12 17:50:31	ergo0	now im getting unregistered torrent erros 
2018-12-12 17:50:37	ergo0	oh well, guess i will add more indexers 
2018-12-12 17:51:05	+xelra	find . -type f -exec chmod 660 {} \;
2018-12-12 17:51:23	+xelra	find . -type d -exec chmod 770 {} \;
2018-12-12 17:51:36	+xelra	One finds files, the other finds directories.
2018-12-12 17:51:38	fryfrog	xelra: `chmod -R a=,a+rX,u+w,g+w /some/path/here`
2018-12-12 17:51:44	+xelra	OMG!
2018-12-12 17:51:45	fryfrog	^ memorize that, it is way better than the find.
2018-12-12 17:52:05	fryfrog	Though you'd need to tune it for your umask 007, that is umask 002
2018-12-12 17:52:51	+xelra	Alright. Need to watch Wintergatan Wednesday now. :)
2018-12-12 17:53:52	+xelra	I like doing things in absolutes. :)
2018-12-12 17:54:14	fryfrog	Your way is ineffecient and what do you think you mean by "absolutes"?
2018-12-12 17:54:57	+xelra	Setting the mode in an absolute way I mean.
2018-12-12 17:55:05	fryfrog	What do you think that chmod is doing?
2018-12-12 17:55:14	fryfrog	Granted, it is a little harder to read.
2018-12-12 17:55:21	fryfrog	But it *is* setting it absolutely.
2018-12-12 17:55:59	+xelra	Also to increase efficiency you can use `find . -type d -exec chmod 770 {} +`
2018-12-12 17:56:01	fryfrog	the first a= clears it, a+rX adds read and read + execute on folders for *all*, the u and g add write to user and group.
2018-12-12 17:56:17	fryfrog	To do your 007, i think it'd be...
2018-12-12 17:56:39	+xelra	What if g doesn't have r to begin with?
2018-12-12 17:56:44	fryfrog	a=,u+rwX,g+rwX
2018-12-12 17:56:51	fryfrog	The a= sets everything to 000
2018-12-12 17:57:11	fryfrog	It literally does exactly what your pair of finds do, but w/o spawning a chmod for *every* file and folder found.
2018-12-12 17:57:23	+xelra	Hmm, and g+w impplies +r?
2018-12-12 17:57:28	fryfrog	No
2018-12-12 17:57:41	fryfrog	The second a=rX sets read for files and folders
2018-12-12 17:57:42	+xelra	Ah, I see it now.
2018-12-12 17:57:51	fryfrog	for *everyone*
2018-12-12 17:57:52	+xelra	Yes, you're right.
2018-12-12 17:57:53	fryfrog	I mean
2018-12-12 17:57:57	fryfrog	for each of the 3
2018-12-12 17:58:13	fryfrog	Someone showed me this recently, I was like omg.
2018-12-12 17:58:30	+xelra	Does it also take care of the 4th octet, if it isn't 0?
2018-12-12 17:58:33	fryfrog	The whole CAP X being +x on folders was crazy.
2018-12-12 17:58:46	fryfrog	Probably not, but neither does yours?
2018-12-12 17:58:58	fryfrog	I'm sure you can add it, since it is just chmod.
2018-12-12 17:59:01	+xelra	Mine is short for 0660.
2018-12-12 17:59:08	+xelra	I think it does.
2018-12-12 17:59:21	fryfrog	Easy enough to test :)
2018-12-12 17:59:27	+xelra	Yes.
2018-12-12 17:59:42	+xelra	If you use {} + it doesn't spawn chmod for every file too though.
2018-12-12 17:59:51	+xelra	It's a batch operation.
2018-12-12 18:00:02	fryfrog	I don't think that is correct
2018-12-12 18:00:21	fryfrog	try `-exec echo '{}' ';'` and see what it does?

2018-12-12 18:00:50	+xelra	It really has to be {} + at the end.
2018-12-12 18:01:10	+xelra	They made this in find, so people wouldn't use xargs.
2018-12-12 18:01:25	fryfrog	https://ptpb.pw/bOLY/shell <- doesn't look like it fixes +s

2018-12-12 18:08:56	+xelra	Have you guys heard of Wintergatan?
2018-12-12 18:09:18	+xelra	He's got a series on YouTube airing every Wednesday.
2018-12-12 18:10:02	+xelra	That guy is so amazing. Starting out with zero knowledge, you can watch him go step by step fighting for his dream.
2018-12-12 18:11:09	+xelra	It's this playlist. And probably the best watch on YouTube at all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8qyVURtSZc&list=PLLLYkE3G1HED6rW-bkliHbMroHYFf4ukv
2018-12-12 18:12:08	+xelra	And this series is the build process of the first marble machine, which was a failure: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkAwf3hlHSE&list=PLLLYkE3G1HEA_68q46Xk1MvK-zGqjLBmA
2018-12-12 18:12:19	+xelra	Every normal person would have given up after that.
2018-12-12 18:18:47	+xelra	If you start with the first machine and then watch the whole thing, the development is just mindboggling.

2018-12-13 01:15:20	keith	no, if it was open, we would see code there, which we do.
2018-12-13 01:15:32	keith	its useless code, and has been, since you cant build it.
2018-12-13 01:15:34	Disconsented	Thats visable not open
2018-12-13 01:15:54	keith	the definition of open is allowing access

2018-12-13 01:17:13	keith	we have access to it
2018-12-13 01:17:25	keith	but to me, this isnt open source anyways, since its unbuildable

2018-12-13 02:13:45	ergo0	well seems like sonarr is having some issues with moving files and renaming 
2018-12-13 02:14:19	ergo0	im not getting any logs tho 
2018-12-13 02:15:24	mastyman	are your sonarr logs set to 'debug'
2018-12-13 02:18:19	+xelra	ergo0: Why don't you have any logs?
2018-12-13 02:22:32	ergo0	xelra: rather there arent any error messages popping up 
2018-12-13 02:22:40	ergo0	also i have not mastyman , lemme try that 
2018-12-13 02:22:46	+xelra	Can you describe the issue then?
2018-12-13 02:23:00	ergo0	ah here we go 
2018-12-13 02:23:44	ergo0	https://a.pste.pw/TDp.png
2018-12-13 02:24:32	+xelra	Looks like permission issues? :)
2018-12-13 02:24:55	ergo0	yes reee
2018-12-13 02:25:23	ergo0	i tried doing chown -R ronin: /media/ 
2018-12-13 02:25:25	ergo0	but no dice 
2018-12-13 02:25:43	+xelra	Let me copy&paste something from earlier today....
2018-12-13 02:25:50	+xelra	<fryfrog> ergo0: depends on your goal, chances are good that since you're setting up poorly now, you'll run into issues later.
2018-12-13 02:25:53	+xelra	^^ :D
2018-12-13 02:25:58	ergo0	yes 
2018-12-13 02:26:08	ergo0	i was aware that this was gonna get brought up 
2018-12-13 02:26:37	+xelra	Are you using a cli interface?
2018-12-13 02:26:47	ergo0	for sonarr you mean? 
2018-12-13 02:26:52	+xelra	In general.
2018-12-13 02:26:52	ergo0	im just using the web gui 
2018-12-13 02:26:57	mastyman	lol
2018-12-13 02:26:57	ergo0	i use terminals ye 
2018-12-13 02:27:04	+xelra	Good.
2018-12-13 02:27:08	ergo0	if thats what ur asking 
2018-12-13 02:27:42	+xelra	So how do you have your library set up? From my understanding, it's the root directory of a mount, right?
2018-12-13 02:27:54	ergo0	yeee 
2018-12-13 02:27:59	ergo0	i have a 2 tb btrfs drive 
2018-12-13 02:28:11	ergo0	which has a folder /media/downloads and /media/anime 
2018-12-13 02:28:46	+xelra	So your library is in /mnt/media/ ?
2018-12-13 02:28:59	ergo0	i made a new dir on root 
2018-12-13 02:29:01	ergo0	called /media/ 
2018-12-13 02:29:06	ergo0	which i use to mount everything 
2018-12-13 02:29:11	ergo0	you thinking that might be the problem? 
2018-12-13 02:29:29	+xelra	No, that's fine. I just wanna get an idea of how you set stuff up.
2018-12-13 02:30:03	XemBot	'Match Game' Returning For Season 4 :: http://www.ismyshowcancelled.com/article/2018-12-12/match-game-returning-for-season-4/
2018-12-13 02:30:16	+xelra	So Sonarr manages /media/anime and /media/tv. And Radarr manages /media/movies. Right?
2018-12-13 02:30:32	+xelra	Which download client are you using?
2018-12-13 02:30:39	ergo0	radarr? 
2018-12-13 02:30:44	ergo0	im not using radarr currently
2018-12-13 02:30:48	ergo0	im using sabnzbd for downloads
2018-12-13 02:30:53	ergo0	and transmission for torrents 
2018-12-13 02:31:01	+xelra	ok.
2018-12-13 02:31:13	ergo0	sabnzbd is also having problems now lol 
2018-12-13 02:31:31	+xelra	So first you should make a group called media.
2018-12-13 02:32:05	ergo0	ayee thats done 
2018-12-13 02:32:55	+xelra	Then everyone who needs to access the library needs to get added to that group.
2018-12-13 02:33:04	+xelra	sonarr, sabnzbd, transmission.
2018-12-13 02:33:07	ergo0	thats just usermod -a -G blabla right? 
2018-12-13 02:33:34	+xelra	Yes, check afterwards with groups user
2018-12-13 02:34:57	ergo0	hmmm 
2018-12-13 02:35:03	ergo0	groups media gives me groups : unknown user media 
2018-12-13 02:35:12	ergo0	nvm im dumb 
2018-12-13 02:35:19	ergo0	ayee thats set up correctly now 
2018-12-13 02:35:52	+xelra	You should also add your user account to media.
2018-12-13 02:36:04	+xelra	Otherwise you won't be able to access it later.
2018-12-13 02:36:22	ergo0	yeee
2018-12-13 02:36:28	ergo0	just did that as well 
2018-12-13 02:36:54	+xelra	Now you fix ownership of the respective directories.
2018-12-13 02:36:59	+xelra	You do that with
2018-12-13 02:37:02	SeepingN	yar. having 1 user in a group is kind of moot
2018-12-13 02:37:18	ergo0	chown -R media:media /media/downloads etc? 
2018-12-13 02:37:23	+xelra	chown -R user:group directory
2018-12-13 02:37:44	+xelra	For the Sonarr directories like /media/anime that would be sonarr:media
2018-12-13 02:38:06	ergo0	also /media/downloads i would assume right? 
2018-12-13 02:38:13	+xelra	If you have /media/movies and Radarr, you would have that as radarr:media
2018-12-13 02:38:14	ergo0	since it has to move files from the downloads folder to the anime folder 
2018-12-13 02:38:32	ergo0	cant i just give the entire media group access to a folder? 
2018-12-13 02:38:59	+xelra	There's no user media.
2018-12-13 02:39:07	+xelra	That's what you're doing right now.
2018-12-13 02:39:49	ergo0	by chowning i change ownership right 
2018-12-13 02:40:11	ergo0	so if i do chown-r sonarr:media /directory and sabnzbd:media after
2018-12-13 02:40:15	+xelra	Yes. When you do sonarr:media, the user will be sonarr and the group will be media.
2018-12-13 02:40:15	ergo0	dont i overwrite the owner? 
2018-12-13 02:40:55	+xelra	You do sonarr:media for /media/anime and sabnzbd:media for whatever download directory sabnzbd uses.
2018-12-13 02:41:14	ergo0	but can sonarr then move files from the download dir 
2018-12-13 02:41:17	ergo0	to the media dir? 
2018-12-13 02:41:49	ergo0	also what if i have plex and sonarr and sabnzbd all interact with the same folder 
2018-12-13 02:41:51	+xelra	When we have 660 for example. The first 6 means rw for user. And the second 6 means rw for group.
2018-12-13 02:42:13	ergo0	ahh okay that makes sense 
2018-12-13 02:42:16	+xelra	They all interact via the media group, which is the second number in the permission octet.
2018-12-13 02:42:29	ergo0	so the user will have ownership but other group members can still interact 
2018-12-13 02:43:14	+xelra	Yes. It's important that the user is correct, because only the user can change permissions and ownership. We get to that in the next step though.
2018-12-13 02:43:25	ergo0	ayee cool 
2018-12-13 02:44:29	ergo0	the renaming bit works for now atleast :) 
2018-12-13 02:44:47	+xelra	Yes, we're almost there.
2018-12-13 02:45:51	+xelra	In the Sonarr settings you can find something like this: https://pasteboard.co/HRt9K6C.png
2018-12-13 02:46:09	ergo0	ahhh yee 
2018-12-13 02:46:13	+xelra	You will need that. So that Sonarr can set the permissions after renaming and Plex can access it.
2018-12-13 02:46:20	ergo0	thats neattt 
2018-12-13 02:46:21	ergo0	thanks alot 
2018-12-13 02:46:34	ergo0	i also learned some stuff about permissions on linux now :) 
2018-12-13 02:47:01	+xelra	The chown user field is empty, because only root can change user. That's a security thing in Linux.
2018-12-13 02:47:21	+xelra	That's why the user was important before.
2018-12-13 02:47:50	+xelra	And now lets clean up permissions of what you already have. This is a one-time job.
2018-12-13 02:48:38	+xelra	find . -type f -exec chmod 660 {} \;
2018-12-13 02:48:38	+xelra	find . -type d -exec chmod 770 {} \;
2018-12-13 02:48:50	ergo0	ayeee 
2018-12-13 02:48:56	+xelra	These two commands will search for files or for directories.
2018-12-13 02:48:57	ergo0	it makes sensoe now 
2018-12-13 02:48:59	+xelra	But wait.
2018-12-13 02:49:07	ergo0	but wont that do all drives? 
2018-12-13 02:49:07	+xelra	The . means "this directory".
2018-12-13 02:49:42	+xelra	So you cd to the directory you want to run this. And then find . will search this directory and subdirs.
2018-12-13 02:49:47	ergo0	so i do that after cd'ing into the media drive 
2018-12-13 02:50:00	+xelra	. always means "this directory" and .. means "the directory above".
2018-12-13 02:50:09	ergo0	yee i am ware of that 
2018-12-13 02:50:15	ergo0	just havent used it in this context before 
2018-12-13 02:50:16	+xelra	I don't know what you have in downloads.
2018-12-13 02:50:31	+xelra	So better run it one level down and then fix the top level manually.
2018-12-13 02:50:36	ergo0	well i will do that and then watch some anime from bed after plex is done :) 
2018-12-13 02:50:47	ergo0	thanks for the help lad 
2018-12-13 02:51:21	+xelra	No problem. Just come back if something still doesn't work.
2018-12-13 02:51:28	ergo0	i will do that 
2018-12-13 02:51:38	ergo0	good evening

2018-12-13 11:03:54	Ether_Man_	Also, a 200x200 is rated to carry over 100kg... You don't need more :)
2018-12-13 11:04:48	Ether_Man_	Or I should say, a 200x200 FM8 is rated for that. There's an FM6 as well which is only for 50kg but :)

2018-12-13 12:44:05	ergo0	seeems like sonarr is still having problems importing episodes
2018-12-13 12:44:13	ergo0	still getting access to the path is denied 
2018-12-13 13:21:50	ergo0	if i chown -R sonarr:media sonarr can import the files
2018-12-13 13:21:59	ergo0	but sabnzbd cant write files to the dir 
2018-12-13 13:22:19	ergo0	if i do chown -R sabnzbd:media  sabnzbd can download files but sonarr cant move em 
2018-12-13 13:23:28	Lartza	So make sure both users are in media group and set correct group permissions
2018-12-13 13:23:44	ergo0	ye both are in the media groups 
2018-12-13 13:24:25	Lartza	Then the directory permissions are wrong
2018-12-13 13:25:00	Lartza	I mean actually
2018-12-13 13:25:18	Lartza	Why are you even using a media group and not just adding sonarr to the sabnzbd group
2018-12-13 13:25:29	ergo0	someone in here recommended me that yesterday 
2018-12-13 13:25:41	Lartza	Aren't you on arch? read the archwiki :P
2018-12-13 13:25:42	ergo0	to make a group for plex, sonarr, sabnzbd,transmission 
2018-12-13 13:26:09	Lartza	But uhh
2018-12-13 13:26:17	Lartza	did you make sure all those daemons then run as the media group
2018-12-13 13:26:50	ergo0	i havent actually 
2018-12-13 13:26:56	ergo0	i just did systemctl enable service 
2018-12-13 13:27:02	ergo0	and start ofcourse 
2018-12-13 13:27:05	Lartza	Because surely sabnzb makes sabnzbd:sabnzbd files
2018-12-13 13:27:07	ergo0	wasnt aware that i had too 
2018-12-13 13:27:13	Lartza	Even if the main folder permission is correct
2018-12-13 13:27:19	Lartza	And it's not bsd
2018-12-13 13:27:28	Lartza	*Since it's not
2018-12-13 13:28:39	ergo0	now i wonder if itsb est to change it in the systemd service files 
2018-12-13 13:28:59	Lartza	Maybe? It's not hard at least

2018-12-14 00:04:43	fryfrog	OH
2018-12-14 00:04:57	fryfrog	Yeah, you need a manual refresh or to wait for the ?dailyish? refresh to happen.
2018-12-14 00:05:07	fryfrog	But that isn't how I read what raidghost said :)
2018-12-14 00:05:48	Ether_Man_	The daily refresh only checks new metadata. It doesn't scan files
2018-12-14 00:05:59	fryfrog	You sure?

2018-12-14 00:35:22	raidghost	Ether_Man_: Its more like i downloaded 720P for months ago. And figured out that i wanted to grab the 1080 instead. So changed from  720P to 1080P in profile for the tvprogram
2018-12-14 00:35:56	Ether_Man_	Ah so what fryfrog read it as. Then yea, you'd not get new eps unless you specifically request it.
2018-12-14 00:35:58	raidghost	and push the search for monitored episodes in the series button
2018-12-14 00:36:19	raidghost	have i not requested when using the search for monitored episodes ?
2018-12-14 00:36:32	Ether_Man_	That depends on your profile settings.
2018-12-14 00:36:46	raidghost	Changed it from 720P to 1080P

2018-12-14 00:39:25	Ether_Man_	And we don't know what you've actually set in your "720P" or "1080P" profile. Those are not standard profile names.
2018-12-14 00:40:34	fryfrog	Your profile would have to both have 1080p, be in the right order and have the cutoff set properly.
2018-12-14 00:40:48	fryfrog	Then, click the search button for the episodes, seasons or shows.
2018-12-14 00:41:07	raidghost	Just what i tried
2018-12-14 00:41:28	fryfrog	Then it should have worked and you'll have to dig in a little to see why.
2018-12-14 00:41:50	fryfrog	Are the episodes monitored? Do they have the gray-ish color quality to indicate cutoff not met?
2018-12-14 00:42:13	raidghost	they are monitored YES
