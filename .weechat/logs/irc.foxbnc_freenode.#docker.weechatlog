2018-12-18 18:19:32	@programmerq	Amnesia? ditch systemd inside a container if you can-- systemd is running on your host and doesn't need to be in the container in almost every case.
2018-12-18 18:19:58	Amnesia	I'm dependent on it for a particular program though
2018-12-18 18:20:08	@programmerq	what program?
2018-12-18 18:20:16	Amnesia	some custom software
2018-12-18 18:20:30	@programmerq	what is it doing that makes it dependent on systemd?
2018-12-18 18:21:27	Amnesia	well, it's being used to monitor its daemons:)
2018-12-18 18:21:49	Amnesia	but can I conclude that sytemd inside of a docker container is a big nono?

2018-12-18 18:32:59	UMpersEgaR	removing a folder that was created in a previous layer will not change the overall size of the image, correct? e.g., 1) RUN git clone blah blah 2) RUN rm -rf the_git_cloned_folder... the image cannot get smaller than the layer with the folder present. am i understanding this correctly?

2018-12-18 18:51:07	@programmerq	UMpersEgaR? that is correct. multistage builds can help here. You would do the clone in an earlier stage, do whatever compile steps you'd need, and then copy the result from the compile to the final stage. The git repository itself wouldn't be in any layer for the resulting image.

2018-12-18 22:49:32	raj	tabakhase, I was under the impression that I use docker to replace my VM that I've been using for dev

2018-12-18 22:50:22	tabakhase	"yes and no"  -- docker is "strictly not to be used like a VM" - somewhat yea, but not rly is the deal :P
2018-12-18 22:50:43	raj	so how does having two images work tabakhase?
2018-12-18 22:50:56	raj	because it's two directory trees?
2018-12-18 22:51:14	tabakhase	so while there are methods to run "multiple processes in one container" - http://phusion.github.io/baseimage-docker/ for some reading - you really only ever wanne do that if you absolutely have too

2018-12-18 22:52:34	tabakhase	so instead, seperate containers - and docker-compose is the deal -- and compose will "chain them together" so one container can resolve the other by name -- see how wordpress uses the mysql under the adress "db" here https://docs.docker.com/compose/wordpress/

2018-12-18 23:12:44	tabakhase	could you just manually create a VM and use that? sure, would be the same -- but the 2 boxed sollutions bring the docker-cli client with them - and docker actually only needs a socket to the VM -- so "docker rum" inside your cmd.exe will work, and actually talk to the VM ;P

2018-12-19 00:16:52	ergo0	it isnt giving me like permission errors, jsut that the path doesnt exist 
2018-12-18 23:17:06	ThiefMaster	yeah it was debugging :) and i just used 'docker cp' in the end to edit the file outside and then copy it back

2018-12-18 23:22:02	tabakhase	raj nothing specificly... the general idea of compose you should prob even ignore for "the first steps" depending on where you are... - and "all compose really does is bundling up a bunch of "docker ..." commands you could run just as well on console -- so "understanding those docker commands first" is vital :P - compose is just a config file so to say
2018-12-18 23:23:07	raj	tabakhase, I'm not sure what you're referring to about compose
2018-12-18 23:23:10	raj	I just wanted to get started
2018-12-18 23:23:16	raj	do I need docker engine or docker client or both?
2018-12-18 23:23:58	tabakhase	so kinda, play around with run&build and all its arguments a bit - and "remember compose" in the very moment you want to "save the docker command in a run.sh file" - because a 500character long "docker run" comand comes reaaallly ugly over time ;D

2018-12-19 01:47:36	The_Letter_M	So I'm running Atomic Host and it has SELinux. When I run a docker and want to add a volume I do "... -v /source/folder:/destination/folder:z" and then SELinux adjusts for the container when it starts. Is it possible to do this in the Dockerfile?
2018-12-19 01:53:36	larsks	The_Letter_M: it's not, because bind mounts only happen at runtime.
2018-12-19 01:53:41	larsks	Not at build time.
2018-12-19 01:55:53	The_Letter_M	ok
2018-12-19 02:04:25	dodobrain	with docker-compose variable substitution, is it possible to say use this variable, if not present/empty use this other variable, if not error or use a default value?

2018-12-19 10:16:45	ExeciN	docker commands work but docker-compose fails like this
2018-12-19 10:17:00	ExeciN	the only thing I could use to make it work is to reboot the server

2018-12-19 10:22:46	Celmor	if using systemd you usualyl use -H fd://
2018-12-19 10:23:29	ExeciN	the error above was with skipping -H and its parameters
2018-12-19 10:24:18	Celmor	your docker daemon have listened on a docker socket but docker-compose could've been incorrectly configured (DOCKER_HOST ernv var, parameters...)
2018-12-19 10:24:32	Celmor	are you using docker-machine in any way?
2018-12-19 10:24:37	ExeciN	no
2018-12-19 10:24:45	ExeciN	just docker + docker-compose
2018-12-19 10:24:46	Celmor	or some "docker for <platform>" installation
2018-12-19 10:25:35	ExeciN	/usr/local/bin/docker-compose is a binary, not a script to use the dockerized version of docker-compose
2018-12-19 10:25:50	ExeciN	also I use native docker
2018-12-19 10:26:03	ExeciN	installed from docker-s apt repo
2018-12-19 10:26:12	ExeciN	*docker's
2018-12-19 10:26:22	Celmor	`docker info` gives you expected output?
2018-12-19 10:28:01	ExeciN	nothing that sticks out https://paste.ngx.cc/r/f25b133bd986bfb4
2018-12-19 10:28:42	Celmor	does `env | grep -i docker` print anything?
2018-12-19 10:29:09	ExeciN	nothing
2018-12-19 10:29:52	Celmor	do you have ~/.docker/config.json ?
2018-12-19 10:30:57	ExeciN	no
2018-12-19 10:31:05	ExeciN	not for root either
2018-12-19 10:31:52	Celmor	you do have /var/run/docker.sock ?
2018-12-19 10:32:30	ExeciN	I do
2018-12-19 10:34:30	ExeciN	however, docker-compose -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock down --remove-orphans failed with ERROR: An HTTP request took too long to complete. Retry with --verbose to obtain debug information. If you encounter this issue regularly because of slow network conditions, consider setting COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT to a higher value (current value: 60).
2018-12-19 10:35:16	velix	What's a good way to start Docker unpriviliged? runc, --user or add a username to the image? Is this still state of the art?
2018-12-19 10:36:42	Celmor	what do you want to do? the docker daemon needs to run as root essentially
2018-12-19 10:36:52	ExeciN	$ sudo systemctl status docker https://paste.ngx.cc/r/b5510edc4da911a2
2018-12-19 10:37:23	velix	Celmor: Oh really? okay, then I'll keep running LXC and systemd-nspawn. You don't need root here.
2018-12-19 10:37:33	Celmor	ExeciN, `docker -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock info` works?
2018-12-19 10:38:17	ExeciN	Celmor: it works
2018-12-19 10:39:23	Celmor	you sure the docker-compose version you use is up-to-date?
2018-12-19 10:39:38	ExeciN	docker-compose version 1.23.2, build 1110ad01
2018-12-19 10:40:58	Celmor	you could try the older version you had before, you can get them via https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/<version>/docker-compose
2018-12-19 10:41:17	Celmor	you could try the older version you had before, you can get them via https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/<version>/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) *
2018-12-19 10:44:14	ExeciN	I downgraded to docker-compose version 1.21.2, build a133471
2018-12-19 10:44:17	ExeciN	same error
2018-12-19 10:47:17	ExeciN	I also just tried with 1.21.1 which is the earliest version that I can use because of compose file format 3.6
2018-12-19 10:47:27	ExeciN	same error
2018-12-19 10:54:40	velix	Celmor: Is there a reason, why docker daemon is still root?
2018-12-19 10:55:23	Celmor	it needs to be able to use kernel features to setup containers, bit syre giw lxc/systemd do it else
2018-12-19 10:55:39	Celmor	with systemd you already have a "daemon" (sytemd init) running as root though
2018-12-19 10:57:06	velix	Celmor: I think, the main concerns are that the processes inside the container are running as root, too.
2018-12-19 10:57:19	velix	Celmor: There are many concepts that make those running as none-root / unpriviliged.
2018-12-19 10:57:43	velix	Sure, Docker is NOT about security, I know.
2018-12-19 10:57:47	Celmor	well, you can make them run as non-root essentially via docker using user-namespaces
2018-12-19 10:57:48	ExeciN	you can use whatever uid you want
2018-12-19 10:57:50	velix	Also nspawn and LXC aren't.
2018-12-19 10:58:01	Celmor	even if the process expects to be root
2018-12-19 10:58:06	velix	Celmor & ExeciN: Yeah, that was my initial question ;)
2018-12-19 10:58:10	Celmor	but often docker images set up a non-root user anyway
2018-12-19 10:58:25	Celmor	well, than be more accurate in what you're asking
2018-12-19 10:58:38	ExeciN	this  is the case inside containers, docker needs root
2018-12-19 10:58:38	velix	Sorry :/
2018-12-19 11:00:48	velix	For example, the official NGINX container doesn't run as another user... I don't anderstand why. Sure, because of port 80. But can't you run it as 8080 in the container and export as 80 ?
2018-12-19 11:01:07	velix	I don't want to have a webserver run as root in a container :)
2018-12-19 11:01:15	velix	Sure, I can start it with --user.
2018-12-19 11:02:53	ExeciN	$ sudo systemctl restart docker.service got stuck here  https://paste.ngx.cc/r/120d06ffee13d44a
2018-12-19 11:03:03	ExeciN	I think the only way to revive it is to reboot
2018-12-19 11:03:57	ExeciN	it sits there for ~6 mins
2018-12-19 11:06:25	velix	ExeciN: That's the exact time, I've waited for the delayed train today... but it came in the end :D
2018-12-19 11:06:58	ExeciN	well now its 9 mins
2018-12-19 11:07:17	ExeciN	this usually takes less than a second
2018-12-19 11:24:06	ExeciN	rebooted
2018-12-19 11:24:20	ExeciN	docker-compose now runs as it should
2018-12-19 11:24:24	ExeciN	what could be the problem
2018-12-19 11:30:25	Celmor	did the path of docker-compose change between upgrade?
2018-12-19 11:31:14	ExeciN	no
2018-12-19 11:45:49	ExeciN	I don't think the problem is with docker-compose
2018-12-19 11:45:58	ExeciN	I think it has something to do with docker
2018-12-19 11:46:07	Celmor	maybe your docker daemon version was still older till you rebooted and may not have accepted docker-composes format
2018-12-19 11:46:56	ExeciN	I don't think so. for the past week, after updating docker and docker-compose. the only way to make them work after this error was to reboot
2018-12-19 11:47:45	ExeciN	so without touching anything, docker-compose commands will fail between 12 and 48 hours
2018-12-19 11:47:59	ExeciN	*after between
2018-12-19 11:49:08	Celmor	only after update though, right? you could try partial update of only docker tools and not server if that also causes the problem
2018-12-19 11:50:15	ExeciN	what I meant was that I updated docker + docker compose about a week ago and after that, docker-compose fails at some point, the only way to fix it was to reboot
2018-12-19 11:52:18	ExeciN	so I rebooted about 5 times since to fix docker-compose failing without updating either docker or docker-compose (except a few mins ago when I was trying different docker-compose versions)
2018-12-19 11:52:27	Celmor	well, did you update the docker engine as well?
2018-12-19 11:53:15	ExeciN	docker -v prints this Docker version 18.09.0, build 4d60db4
2018-12-19 11:53:18	ExeciN	if this is what you mean
2018-12-19 11:53:37	ExeciN	which is the latest release afaik
2018-12-19 11:55:37	Celmor	that's only the version of the "docker" cli client
2018-12-19 11:55:49	Celmor	docker info prints the server version
2018-12-19 11:56:48	sagner	I try to use digest in docker compose. However, when using alpine@sha256:196d12cf6ab19273823e700516e98eb1910b03b17840f9d5509f03858484d321 in docker-compose.yml docker-compose complains saying ERROR: manifest for ... not found.
2018-12-19 11:57:09	sagner	Is it possible to use full sha256 digest in docker compose?
2018-12-19 11:57:17	ExeciN	Server Version: 18.09.0
2018-12-19 11:58:03	Celmor	that
2018-12-19 11:58:11	Celmor	that's the one you should look out for when updating then
2018-12-19 11:59:19	ExeciN	the first reboot after upgrading docker (and presumably docker engine as well) was about a week ago
2018-12-19 11:59:44	ExeciN	I didn't touch anything since (except from today) yet I still had to reboot for docker-compose to work
2018-12-19 12:00:38	ExeciN	because for some reason docker-compose fails at some point timing out
2018-12-19 12:01:03	ExeciN	now that it works I can even use -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock
2018-12-19 12:01:26	Celmor	sagner, where did you get that digest from? seems it just doesn't exist
2018-12-19 12:01:31	ExeciN	when it decides to stop working then I can only get it back with a reboot
2018-12-19 12:01:40	Celmor	if I check a digest for a local alpine image and then pull it, it works fine
2018-12-19 12:02:17	Celmor	so updates since the reboot?
2018-12-19 12:02:49	ExeciN	no updates after reboot
2018-12-19 12:03:12	ExeciN	could it be some kernel config working against me?
2018-12-19 12:03:23	Celmor	then check the logs, and enable verbose/debug mode
2018-12-19 12:03:49	Celmor	haven't heard of that being the case for anyone so far

2018-12-19 15:29:47	jarlopez	UMpersEgaR: Mm I see. I only ask because I have a tight self-imposed deadline for this project, and am considering dockerizing only after the app is up and running
2018-12-19 15:29:49	UMpersEgaR	but also, the same containers make dev a lot easier too
2018-12-19 15:29:55	UMpersEgaR	so it can be useful to start with them from the get-go

2018-12-19 15:30:29	UMpersEgaR	yeah thats fair. get your app up on your droplet, then deal with dockerizing

2018-12-19 15:31:39	UMpersEgaR	you will always be able to create a container that matches the current status (almost) of your app on the droplet, then once you figure it out, its just a matter of switching out the old app with the new docker.

2018-12-19 17:14:17	@ada	because $RANDOM isn't a variable its a function
2018-12-19 17:14:22	@ada	and it isn't defined in 'sh'

2018-12-19 18:12:42	@ada	I don't recommend you split managers, for quorum reasons - there are strategies for stacking managers in different regions though so your management cluster can survive a region loss
2018-12-19 18:13:00	@ada	the main thing you worry about is network latency between the managers for getting consensus

2018-12-19 18:13:37	jayjo	that was exactly my question, actually. I thought raft could have some issues with the latency but I don't know how sensitive it is
2018-12-19 18:13:39	@ada	you can do something like 2-1-2 managers in 3 different regions, so if you lose 1 whole region you still have N>(n/2+1) managers alive

2018-12-19 18:55:49	jenia	if I run a container in a network and expose port 8080, then this port is used only inside the docker network right? If I have another program on the host using the same port, they won't clash?
2018-12-19 18:56:30	@programmerq	jenia? each container gets its own ip address and virtual network interface. If something in the container listens on port 8080, it only affects that container. Other containers can also listen on 8080 on their own ip as well.
2018-12-19 18:56:32	Celmor	"expose" doesn't do much by itself, more of a documentation for the image
2018-12-19 18:56:34	@programmerq	If you *publish* a port
2018-12-19 18:56:43	@programmerq	that'll forward traffic from the host in to a container
2018-12-19 18:56:51	@programmerq	you can only have one thing listening on a port at a time on the host
2018-12-19 18:57:16	@programmerq	so if you map the host's 8080 to some port on container A, then that port is in use on the host and you won't be able to map it simultaneously to another container.
2018-12-19 18:57:44	@programmerq	if both containers are http servers, then you can set up a reverse proxy that directs traffic by http Host header, path, SNI information, etc.

2018-12-19 19:27:25	@programmerq	specifying a driver on start doesn't make sense.
2018-12-19 19:27:41	@programmerq	jenia? EXPOSE in the dockerfile is only metadata in the image. Publishing is a separate thing.

2018-12-19 19:30:50	Celmor	not the "real" error though, was just trying to help make it find the machine I guess
2018-12-19 19:31:43	Celmor	I can ls and rm the machine, I see the disk and stuff in .docker/machine/machines and saw the machine in the virtualbox interface but starting it never works
2018-12-19 19:31:46	@programmerq	two things to do to help troubleshoot: 1) run all docker-machine commands with the --debug option: docker-machine --debug ...
2018-12-19 19:31:49	Celmor	tried re-creating it
2018-12-19 19:32:00	@programmerq	2) open the virtualbox gui and watch what is happening while docker-machine does its thing

2018-12-19 19:32:29	@programmerq	the output you showed shows that docker-machine is creating a VM, waiting for SSH to be available, and configuring docker successfully.
2018-12-19 19:32:45	@programmerq	it seems like once you stop and start the VM is when things go south.
2018-12-19 19:32:52	Celmor	after the docker-machine create operation where it said at the end that the machine was running the virtualbox interface says it was stopped
2018-12-19 19:33:02	@programmerq	opening the VM in the virtualbox gui can give you more visibility into what is happening
2018-12-19 19:33:33	Celmor	just said that it was stopped, trying to start it via virtualbox causes error with not much info
2018-12-19 19:33:49	Celmor	"failed to create session" or similar
2018-12-19 19:34:49	@programmerq	Celmor? are you able to run any virtualbox machine outside the context of docker-machine?

2018-12-19 19:38:26	@programmerq	there are manual instructions too-- basically you install the yum or apt repo and install the package.

2018-12-19 19:39:16	Celmor	Either your platform is not easily detectable or is not supported by this installer script.
2018-12-19 19:39:27	Celmor	would prefer to get it working via docker-machine anyway
2018-12-19 19:39:39	@programmerq	kali isn't a targeted distro by the get.docker.com scrip. there are packages for debian and ubuntu packages. IIRC, there are instructions for using debian or ubuntu third party packages in kali.
2018-12-19 19:39:45	@programmerq	kali itself my also provide a docker package.

2018-12-19 19:40:21	@programmerq	but if the virtualbox VM is throwing errors in the virtualbox gui, it sounds like you have a virtualbox level issue.
2018-12-19 19:40:52	Celmor	yeah 'docker - transitional package' installing it didn't do much

2018-12-19 19:41:41	Celmor	can I just install a VM from the boot2docker iso and get a prompt/tty access to setup ssh for docker-machine?
2018-12-19 19:42:01	@programmerq	technically you could do that. It's not very user friendly.

2018-12-19 19:42:23	@programmerq	it looks for a partition with some magic piece of data and you have to do that bit manually.
2018-12-19 19:42:48	@programmerq	the author of boot2docker actually ran it on hardware with the boot2docker iso on an actual cd drive back when it was new.
2018-12-19 19:43:05	Celmor	when doing the `docker-machine create -d virtualbox` it seems to have setup a VM with a minimally sized disk and the iso as part of the VM, so I guess it boots form the issue and uses the disk for persistency?
2018-12-19 19:43:14	@programmerq	yup

2018-12-19 19:44:21	Celmor	so I'll have to setup that disk myself I suppose, boot2docker doesn't format attached disks or anything like that automatically?
2018-12-19 19:45:10	Celmor	seems there's only hyper-v and virtualbox as "managed" VMs so  my only choice is getting it working with virtualbox
2018-12-19 19:45:37	raj	why is docker saved to the c:\Users\Public directory on Windows?

2018-12-19 19:46:31	Celmor	hyper-v usually puts its disk image files there afaik
2018-12-19 19:46:53	Celmor	docker itself should be using c:\programdata
2018-12-19 19:47:02	@programmerq	Celmor? it formats the disk that has been marked for its use.
2018-12-19 19:47:44	Celmor	can I look up how to "mark" it? is it just a GPT type or some partition label setting?
2018-12-19 19:47:55	@programmerq	it's buried in the boot2docker source code somewhere

2018-12-19 19:52:26	@ada	raj: when you did "docker run hello-world" your docker engine downloaded the hello-world image and ran it.  the hello-world image simply prints "hello world" and exits
2018-12-19 19:52:46	@ada	raj: your container ran, printed, then exited.  do "docker ps -a" to see exited containers.  try "docker logs <container>" to get teh logs of the hello-world container
2018-12-19 19:52:49	@ada	you should see that it printed
2018-12-19 19:53:09	@ada	raj: if you don't give your container a name, it gets a randomly-assigned one
2018-12-19 19:53:49	raj	but it's just a temporary container that gets destroyed once the hello-world script exits after printing its hello?
2018-12-19 19:54:07	tabakhase	toolbox also "just uses machine" so i guess thats a yes? (it also doesnt use ssh but tcp&certs what machine ships on its own)
2018-12-19 19:54:07	Celmor	only if you used --rm

2018-12-19 19:57:55	Celmor	tabakhase, there wasn't much to see there, just a created not-running VM
2018-12-19 19:58:01	raj	do these exited containers not matter?

2018-12-19 19:58:32	@ada	raj: it doesn't until you do it
2018-12-19 19:58:41	@ada	raj: unless you add a --rm flag to remove automatically
2018-12-19 19:58:50	raj	ada, is it important to do that?
2018-12-19 19:58:52	@ada	raj: they _could_ matter.  it depends on the use case
2018-12-19 19:58:58	Celmor	tabakhase, tried setting it up earlier on someones laptop, gonna try later again on another windows instance
2018-12-19 19:59:01	@ada	raj: sometimes you may want an exited container because you want to see its logs to see why it crashed
2018-12-19 19:59:05	@ada	raj: sometimes you don't want that
2018-12-19 19:59:07	@ada	raj: its up to you
2018-12-19 19:59:34	@ada	raj: it will always create a new container when you "docker run"
2018-12-19 19:59:57	Celmor	raj, containers are light-weight, so unless the process in it wrote tons of logs or files, there shouldn't be much more than the metadata for docker that this container exists
2018-12-19 20:00:09	tabakhase	Celmor k, feel free to bump - maintaining ~10 peoples setups with vb/vagrant/docker - so ive seen pretty much every error message virtualbox can spit out by now ;D
2018-12-19 20:00:55	Celmor	tabakhase, well, you've seen the error docker-machine spits out, I shouldn't need to use virtualbox' GUI when using docker-machine with virtualbox driver, or so I thought

2018-12-19 21:27:21	@programmerq	you can see the same info by looking at the output of 'docker image inspect <image>' so you don't have to push and look in the gui

2018-12-19 21:58:32	nickjj	you can't because docker-compose.exe is completely broken if you try to run it directly
2018-12-19 21:58:46	nickjj	it won't run in the foreground properly, and CTRL+C doesn't even register (it's a known issue)
2018-12-19 21:59:43	nickjj	so using docker.exe or docker-compose.exe interactively is out of the picture -- but for any type of web development, you would want interactivity, which is why you end up installing the Docker CLI and compose in there directly
2018-12-19 22:01:25	nickjj	and the last few sentences would be bad to follow because 18.03+ lets you set a custom /etc/wsl.conf mount point so you don't need to bind mount things in your bashrc
2018-12-19 22:01:33	nickjj	windows 18.03+ that is

2018-12-19 22:03:15	nickjj	no that's 18.09, and it's not infamous in any way if you're using windows 10 pro (which you probably are if you're using docker for windows)
2018-12-19 22:03:37	Celmor	the version string in my VM is "1803"
2018-12-19 22:03:58	nickjj	then you can edit your wsl.conf and not have to worry about bind mounting things in your bashrc

2018-12-20 00:17:03	jtreminio	Almost seems like docker-compose should be a container itself haha
2018-12-20 00:17:06	@ada	it is :)
2018-12-20 00:17:12	@ada	but its not an arm container
2018-12-20 00:17:21	@ada	https://hub.docker.com/r/docker/compose/
2018-12-20 00:17:45	Celmor	kinda there should be according to the "build, ship, run anywhere" principle :P
2018-12-20 00:18:03	@ada	well, I mean ... you're not wrong but the audience for arm is small
2018-12-20 00:18:10	@ada	the source code is there though :)

2018-12-20 00:18:42	Surfer2010	so i need to do the berthon.eu method?
2018-12-20 00:18:42	Celmor	what if he gets a python container for arm and runs docker-compose in that...
2018-12-20 00:18:48	@ada	Surfer2010: i don't know, maybe
2018-12-20 00:19:02	@ada	Surfer2010: you likely have to build compose yourself.  the source code is available, and this person wrote a guide that's relatively recent
2018-12-20 00:19:10	@ada	Celmor: maybe?
2018-12-20 00:19:18	@ada	Celmor: that might work
2018-12-20 00:19:42	Celmor	https://hub.docker.com/_/python seems to be available in arm
2018-12-20 00:19:55	Celmor	not sure if that works on arm71, or whatever that is, too
2018-12-20 00:20:08	@ada	that's the other downside with arm is that theres like 12 of them
2018-12-20 00:20:27	jtreminio	build docker-compose through a python container so you can container while you container
2018-12-20 00:20:32	@ada	lol
2018-12-20 00:21:02	Celmor	and docker hub doesn't seem to differentiate between these arm version so it's down to luck if the arm container runs on your arm platform or not...
2018-12-20 00:21:12	Celmor	(or popularity of your arm platform)
2018-12-20 00:22:38	@ada	you will find that some authors use a specific tag for their arm images like :armhf or :arm71
2018-12-20 00:22:44	@ada	and some will use multi-arch images using a manifest
2018-12-20 00:22:57	@ada	the multi-arch ones are hard to suss out, I can't remember if there's a way to see the manifest on dockerhub
2018-12-20 00:23:00	Surfer2010	trying to follow his tut. mhhhh
2018-12-20 00:23:49	Surfer2010	not sure if i will get it to work ... never built anything so far :D

2018-12-20 00:24:43	@ada	Surfer2010: but really the instructions are better
2018-12-20 00:25:00	@ada	Surfer2010: if you just download a binary from someone, how do you know that thing does the thing it says on the tin
2018-12-20 00:25:20	@ada	if you build it yourself, you at least know that unless your compiler (or the upstream source) isn't compromised you're getting the thing you wanted

2018-12-20 00:25:52	Surfer2010	me too
2018-12-20 00:26:05	@ada	also those instructions might be making certain assumptions
2018-12-20 00:26:13	@ada	I have no guarantee as to their feasability
2018-12-20 00:26:27	Celmor	seems like the pi3 chip is 64 bit but the distro only 32 bit, might limit what containers can be run?
2018-12-20 00:26:30	@ada	that `sed` command in there looks like there is a major assumption being made about the build environment
2018-12-20 00:26:33	Celmor	or executables for that matter
2018-12-20 00:26:39	@ada	possibly?

2018-12-20 00:35:33	Surfer2010	yes

2018-12-20 00:38:54	Surfer2010	but wouldn't it start the container inside the container then?

2018-12-20 00:44:38	Celmor	if you wanna use docker-compose through the python image you should probably build one with docker-compose pre-installed through pip and docker-compose as entrypoint
2018-12-20 00:45:22	Surfer2010	to many things in one sentence ^^
2018-12-20 00:45:25	Surfer2010	you mean
2018-12-20 00:45:42	Surfer2010	build an image (as the one i'm logged into right now) as a ready to use one?
2018-12-20 00:46:04	Celmor	sure
2018-12-20 00:46:19	Surfer2010	can't i just "save" the one i'm in right now`?
2018-12-20 00:46:35	Celmor	yeah, but that's not "best practice"
2018-12-20 00:46:46	Surfer2010	ok so i need to make a Dockerfile
2018-12-20 00:47:04	Celmor	also easier to use if you build one with the correct entrypoint so you don't have to "log into" the container and use docker-compose form a shell there
2018-12-20 00:47:22	Surfer2010	got some time tomorrow during the day? :D .... would be nice to have s/o to get help on the way

2018-12-20 07:18:14	walbo	i'm trying to access a container with "docker exec -it [container-id] bash" but keep getting errors since bash doesn't seem to be working
2018-12-20 07:18:17	walbo	or sh
2018-12-20 07:18:58	-->	slajax (~slajax@S01066c709fd7243f.vn.shawcable.net) has joined #docker
2018-12-20 07:19:15	@ada	walbo: is sh or bash included in your image? you can only run binaries that exist in your image
2018-12-20 07:19:27	@ada	walbo: you could show the exact command you ran and the error
2018-12-20 07:19:51	walbo	I have absolutely no clue, I didn't make this i'm just trying to add a new user to the system
2018-12-20 07:20:33	@ada	what is "this"
2018-12-20 07:20:47	@ada	you have some kind of image I assume, that someone wrote
2018-12-20 07:20:52	@ada	did it come from dockerhub?
2018-12-20 07:20:53	walbo	error is OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: container_linux.go:348: starting container process caused "exec: \bash\": executable file not found in $PATH": unknown
2018-12-20 07:20:58	@ada	did you develop the image yourself?
2018-12-20 07:21:07	@ada	so "bash" is not found on the $PATH
2018-12-20 07:21:10	@ada	likely bash is not installed
2018-12-20 07:21:12	walbo	I have ssh'd into a rancher folder and ran rancher
2018-12-20 07:21:30	walbo	using docker ps I have found the name of the container i'd like to access
2018-12-20 07:21:38	walbo	but have run into the above issue
2018-12-20 07:21:58	@ada	like I said
2018-12-20 07:22:00	@ada	bash is not installed
2018-12-20 07:22:06	@ada	whatever image you are using does not include bash
2018-12-20 07:22:15	walbo	yeah
2018-12-20 07:22:21	@ada	e.g. write a Dockerfile that includes bash if that's what you desire
2018-12-20 07:22:22	walbo	any idea how i can access it then
2018-12-20 07:22:25	walbo	oh
2018-12-20 07:22:27	@ada	what does "access" mean to you
2018-12-20 07:22:32	@ada	what are you actually trying to solve
2018-12-20 07:22:41	@ada	you want to change something about the image, what is it
2018-12-20 07:22:48	walbo	get inside and see the files. What i'm trying to solve is finding out the admin user and pass
2018-12-20 07:22:59	@ada	to what end
2018-12-20 07:23:01	walbo	which uses this thing filebrowser.github.io
2018-12-20 07:23:02	@ada	what is the ultimate goal
2018-12-20 07:23:07	walbo	log into it
2018-12-20 07:23:22	walbo	no one knows the admin user or pass

2018-12-20 07:23:55	@ada	and you think the "admin" user name and pass is saved somewhere in the container?
2018-12-20 07:24:12	walbo	I'm guessing
2018-12-20 07:24:29	walbo	Haha, so any idea what I should do in this situation where no one knows admin user or pass or any user logins?

2018-12-20 07:24:52	@ada	so this really doesn't have anything to do with docker, but first I'd look to where that thing stores data

2018-12-20 07:24:57	@ada	typically a database
2018-12-20 07:25:01	@ada	a user table, commonly
2018-12-20 07:25:21	walbo	i thought the database would be inside the container
2018-12-20 07:25:22	@ada	in this case, since the image author didn't include a shell, maybe they have some other way of configuring the app
2018-12-20 07:25:26	@ada	not necessarily
2018-12-20 07:25:36	@ada	I mean, you deployed it so you would be able to find out
2018-12-20 07:25:36	walbo	yes true
2018-12-20 07:25:38	@ada	I can't
2018-12-20 07:25:46	@ada	docker ps shows you running containers
2018-12-20 07:25:50	@ada	docker inspect lets you inspect their config
2018-12-20 07:25:59	@ada	there are volume mounts that let you persist data to the host's disk
2018-12-20 07:26:14	@ada	if there's a mount for a database, then I might use "mysqlclient" and try to dump the users table
2018-12-20 07:26:34	@ada	if it's configured via an environment variable, the "docker inspect" might be able to tell you
2018-12-20 07:26:43	@ada	because "inspect" will print the container's env vars
2018-12-20 07:26:49	@ada	so you really need to understand your application to know what to debug
2018-12-20 07:27:05	@ada	docker isn't a silver bullet it is just a fancy way to run a process

2018-12-20 07:27:41	walbo	config has Cmd"; [ "/config/filebrowser.db"
2018-12-20 07:27:59	@ada	so if you can predict what file holds the data you're after, you could "docker cp container:/path/to/file ~/destfile" maybe
2018-12-20 07:28:10	@ada	otherwise I can't help you without knowing more about the application

2018-12-20 09:51:59	binarious	Hi there. Quite new to docker. I want to use the docker image ?nextcloud? which uses ?php? as its base. When php releases a security update and pushes a new docker image, do I have to wait for nextcloud to build and push a new image with the php update or does docker download the new php layer itself on docker pull nextcloud?

2018-12-20 11:52:21	Goon3r	is there anywhere listing the propagation options available when using bind? its not on that documentation page

2018-12-20 11:53:01	Celmor	"build"?
2018-12-20 11:53:19	Goon3r	"docker-compose build"
2018-12-20 11:53:31	Celmor	but volume doesn't matter during build

2018-12-20 11:53:41	Celmor	bind volumes especially
2018-12-20 11:54:00	Goon3r	assumed the compose file is parsed prior to build and the validation error stopped build
2018-12-20 11:54:11	Goon3r	my guess is, without test, it would be thrown during all compose commands

2018-12-20 11:56:13	Celmor	yeah, it validates before, so parsing just succeeds now, successful build is just a consequence of that
2018-12-20 11:56:29	Goon3r	makes sense to me
2018-12-20 11:56:36	Celmor	did you check https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-bind-propagation ?

2018-12-20 11:57:27	Goon3r	i dont think propagation is what i needed
2018-12-20 11:57:28	Celmor	but I guess that needs mount instead of volume key which is a bit more flexible but also requires more "detail"

2018-12-20 11:57:55	Goon3r	i was hoping to find a way of configuring one way mounts
2018-12-20 11:58:14	Celmor	one way mounts?
2018-12-20 11:58:19	Goon3r	so say i mount /a (host) to /b (container)
2018-12-20 11:58:31	Goon3r	if i create /b/test.txt using an exec run command on the container
2018-12-20 11:58:36	Goon3r	it will not be present in /a
2018-12-20 11:59:02	Celmor	if it's a normal mount, it should, not sure what you  mean by "mount"
2018-12-20 11:59:14	Goon3r	bind volume
2018-12-20 11:59:21	Goon3r	mount host dir to container dir

2018-12-20 12:00:38	Celmor	works fine for me
2018-12-20 12:01:03	Celmor	`mkdir /tmp/a && docker run --rm -v /tmp/a:/b alpine touch /b/test.txt && rm -vrd /tmp/a` lists /tmp/a/test.txt being deleted
2018-12-20 12:02:44	Goon3r	ill keep investigating and pop back
2018-12-20 12:02:46	Celmor	works via exec too: mkdir /tmp/a && docker exec $(docker run --rm -v /tmp/a:/b -d alpine sleep 5) touch /b/test.txt && rm -vrd /tmp/a
2018-12-20 12:03:12	Goon3r	i think i solve my problem by simply setting the volume as read only
2018-12-20 12:03:52	Goon3r	stops the container being able to write the files, thus, no new files make it back to the host dir

2018-12-20 12:40:12	Celmor	so what's the problem, nobody should be able to assign your secret to some other service you don't want to

2018-12-20 12:41:01	Mo0O	anybody who's able to lauch a service can read whatever secret

2018-12-20 13:06:53	Celmor	and if you use encryption you need the key somewhere available for the container
2018-12-20 13:07:36	Celmor	since I use normal docker containers I use pipes to pass in secrets into the container so I know the contasiner can only read them when it starts but nothing else can after that

2018-12-20 15:12:41	@programmerq	CustosLimen? I think there was some work done on this with the buildkit effort. I don't know if it's been exposed in Docker 18.09, but you could use buildkit directly with whatever frontend you want.
2018-12-20 15:12:57	CustosLimen	thanks programmerq will check it out
2018-12-20 15:14:06	@programmerq	CustosLimen? https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/frontend/dockerfile/docs/experimental.md#experimental-syntaxes
2018-12-20 15:14:19	@programmerq	I'm not sure how up-to-date that file is, but I believe you can still follow that section.
2018-12-20 15:14:45	CustosLimen	Thanks a bunhc programmerq - very helpful
2018-12-20 15:14:52	CustosLimen	Seems to be what I am looking for
2018-12-20 15:15:13	@programmerq	as far as I know, the 18.09 'docker build' command won't do those experimental syntaxes, and you'd need to run buildkit directly.

I can ping it, but not connect to the port unless it's not on that machine I am targeting.

2018-12-20 17:35:33	Tazmain	mask it ?
2018-12-20 17:35:34	@ada	systemctl mask firewalld links the unit file to /dev/null
2018-12-20 17:35:40	@ada	so it cant accidentally be started ever
2018-12-20 17:35:52	Tazmain	can't just disable the firewall
2018-12-20 17:35:52	@ada	systemctl disable just turns it off for auto-start on boot
2018-12-20 17:35:56	@ada	its not a firewall
2018-12-20 17:35:59	@ada	its just a firewall interface
2018-12-20 17:36:03	Tazmain	oh right
2018-12-20 17:36:04	@ada	iptables is your firewall

2018-12-20 17:36:43	@ada	add your rules to the DOCKER-USER chain in iptables instead
2018-12-20 17:36:48	@ada	that way you can still customize your rules
2018-12-20 17:37:32	Tazmain	ada: okasy so all that aside, so it seems like I should be able to connect to the host:port that the container is on right?

2018-12-20 17:38:21	@ada	then something is wrong
2018-12-20 17:38:28	Tazmain	can still ping, but the ports are not accessible
2018-12-20 17:38:28	@ada	but the networking path is very simple
2018-12-20 17:38:33	@ada	ping is icmp
2018-12-20 17:38:38	@ada	what does "ports not accessible mean"
2018-12-20 17:38:43	@ada	netcat via tcp? netcat via udp?
2018-12-20 17:38:50	@ada	protocols matter here
2018-12-20 17:38:52	Tazmain	can't connect to the desired port anymore
2018-12-20 17:39:00	Tazmain	tcp protocol

2018-12-20 17:39:14	Tazmain	on the host?
2018-12-20 17:39:16	@ada	first thing I'd do is disabble/mask firewalld and then restart the daemon
2018-12-20 17:39:18	@ada	yes
2018-12-20 17:39:29	@ada	and networkmanager is also garbage and likes to fuck around with network config
2018-12-20 17:39:41	@ada	so I disable that completely on my docker hosts.  they don't need dynamic network configs

2018-12-20 19:37:49	@ada	quesker: it lets you expose sockets to control docker
2018-12-20 19:38:02	@ada	quesker: by default we only set up a local unix socket - that option could be used to create a TCP listening socket for example
2018-12-20 19:38:20	@ada	don't usually recommend changing that without a specific reason
2018-12-20 19:38:34	quesker	you wouldn't need --tlsverify if not using -H right?
2018-12-20 19:38:43	@ada	the daemon runs as root so anything with access to the control socket is effectively root on your box
2018-12-20 19:38:48	@ada	ah correct
2018-12-20 19:38:57	@ada	you don't need --tlsverify with the local unix socket

That means, the command `chown` didn't get executed which fixes the permission. The next time the job ran, it kept failing since the owner of the directory is now root.

2018-12-20 21:53:15	npgm	yes, go mod download is occurring in my package, I have a dependency on docker 1.13
2018-12-20 21:54:07	@ada	so assume I have no idea how go mod download works
2018-12-20 21:54:14	@ada	what is it looking for to figure out what to download
2018-12-20 21:54:25	@ada	a "gemfile"?  if so can you show it?
2018-12-20 21:54:31	@ada	want to see the source of the download
2018-12-20 21:57:46	npgm	these are the relevant lines: https://linx.li/1bpnb8nr.txt
2018-12-20 21:58:47	@ada	little out of my element but when I look for the "golang docker library" on goog I find this instead https://github.com/docker/go-docker
2018-12-20 21:58:59	@ada	I may be wrong and that's not the right thing
2018-12-20 21:59:01	@ada	not sure
2018-12-20 21:59:36	@ada	github.com/docker/docker is the entire daemon though iirc
2018-12-20 21:59:42	@ada	do you just need an API client or a whole docker daemon?
2018-12-20 22:03:49	fx9	new to docker, is it possible to build a docker container with Centos 7, then move that container to run on a different host that runs Centos 6?
2018-12-20 22:12:47	Celmor	you don't need to build an image for centos, just download one from the docker hub
2018-12-20 22:12:58	Celmor	and docker images are designed to be independant from the host
2018-12-20 22:13:22	Celmor	you might have a wrong assumption of how docker is used
2018-12-20 22:13:32	Celmor	it's for deploying services/apps, not running distros
2018-12-20 22:15:33	enderandpeter	fx9: Yeah, to echo Celmor you should be able to run any docker image on any latest version of docker. And yeah, find an official centos 7 image or something to expand upon.
2018-12-20 22:16:14	Celmor	but don't expect a full centos environment, you'll have issues if you want to use it like a desktop os or even like a VM
2018-12-20 22:18:06	corn13read	I've run into this issue a couple times with swarm. Brand new swarm cluster, when doing stack deploy no containers deployed have external DNS working. Standard docker run containers have resolution properly
2018-12-20 22:18:20	corn13read	I've deleted the network it created when doing a deploy and deployed again
2018-12-20 22:18:22	corn13read	rebooted hosts
2018-12-20 22:18:30	corn13read	nothing fixes external DNS
2018-12-20 22:19:58	Celmor	external DNS being public dns servers or a custom one configured on your host?
2018-12-20 22:20:12	Celmor	you can ping 8.8.8.8?
2018-12-20 22:20:20	corn13read	I can ping ip's but not google.com
2018-12-20 22:20:55	Celmor	you could try overriding the used dns server in the container but then you won't be able to use dockers dns
2018-12-20 22:22:00	corn13read	Celmor, that does work
2018-12-20 22:22:35	raj	on Windows, do people commonly put their dockerfile in c:\users\raj\.docker? Or is that directory used for other purposes? I currently see config.json and daemon.json in there
2018-12-20 22:22:45	Celmor	corn13read,  what exactly?
2018-12-20 22:22:53	corn13read	replacing resolv.conf contents with nameserver 8.8.8.8 makes external resolution work fine
2018-12-20 22:22:54	@ada	raj: that dir is for client config files
2018-12-20 22:23:02	@ada	raj: typically your Dockerfile lives in the root of your project repo
2018-12-20 22:23:08	Celmor	and docker machines
2018-12-20 22:23:41	raj	thank you ada
2018-12-20 22:23:49	corn13read	Celmor, the docker hosts have external resolutoin working
2018-12-20 22:24:02	corn13read	standard started docker containers work fine too
2018-12-20 22:24:07	corn13read	only swarm containers don't
2018-12-20 22:24:49	Celmor	can you add dns server via docker service create
2018-12-20 22:25:23	fx9	Celmor, enderandpeter, I'm not using it as a full centos environment or a VM, for that i'd use vmware. I'm trying to use an application that was built for centos 7 to run on centos 6
2018-12-20 22:25:30	@ada	corn13read: sounds like an iptables issue, or docker_gwbridge problem
2018-12-20 22:25:48	corn13read	Celmor, quite possibly, I'm more interested in finding out why this isn't working. This is the second cluster that did this to me
2018-12-20 22:25:55	corn13read	These are brand new docker-machine hosts
2018-12-20 22:26:01	corn13read	all the proper ports are open
2018-12-20 22:26:03	Celmor	fx9, how is it build for centos? it just uses centos packages?
2018-12-20 22:26:07	enderandpeter	fx9: You should see if there is an official docker container for that application and just use that, because the OS won't matter.
2018-12-20 22:26:08	@ada	corn13read: in swarm, whenever a call to getaddrinfo() is made, we intercept the dns request from the contaienr and check Docker's service discovery database.  if it doesn't find a match it just passes the request out the host which uses resolv.conf
2018-12-20 22:26:13	Celmor	or does it have distro dependencies
2018-12-20 22:26:17	@ada	corn13read: you said docker-machine
2018-12-20 22:26:30	@ada	corn13read: is this on windows by chance?
2018-12-20 22:26:33	corn13read	I created the ec2 instances with docker-machine
2018-12-20 22:26:38	corn13read	not on windows
2018-12-20 22:26:47	enderandpeter	fx9: What application/service do you want to run?
2018-12-20 22:26:48	@ada	aws SGs allow egress?
2018-12-20 22:27:06	@ada	what about between cluster nodes
2018-12-20 22:27:17	corn13read	egress from machines works fine
2018-12-20 22:27:18	fx9	enderandpeter, a custom national weather service application called Awips
2018-12-20 22:27:35	fx9	it was built for centos 7, but i'm trying to run it on a host with centos 6
2018-12-20 22:28:17	enderandpeter	fx9: What program(s) is it based on? What does it need to run?
2018-12-20 22:28:51	fx9	I guess centos 7 packages
2018-12-20 22:29:21	Celmor	fx9, well, just try it in a corresponding centos image then, pull the right version, get an interactive container and try to get your app going
2018-12-20 22:29:27	enderandpeter	fx9: Well, you should find out which ones specifically, because they are just programs running in Centos 7 that can more than likely run in other Linux OSes.
2018-12-20 22:29:37	Celmor	fx9, does it use a GUI?
2018-12-20 22:29:44	fx9	Celmor, no GUI
2018-12-20 22:29:56	fx9	it runs as a server application
2018-12-20 22:30:15	Celmor	should work fine then
2018-12-20 22:30:58	fx9	then its like magic :D running a centos 7 docker container on centos 6
2018-12-20 22:31:01	fx9	host
2018-12-20 22:31:34	Celmor	"docker isn't magic" I think that's somewhere in the docs
2018-12-20 22:31:47	enderandpeter	fx9: Might you be able to take a look and find out what programs specifically it uses? It very likely that it doesn't need to be using Centos anything. If you find out the specific requirements, you can more efficiently and port-ably establish a context for it.
2018-12-20 22:31:57	corn13read	default contents of resolv.conf are: search ec2.internal       \n        nameserver 127.0.0.11         \n               options ndots:0
2018-12-20 22:33:10	@ada	Celmor: I said that in my dockercon eu talk on debugging
2018-12-20 22:33:22	@ada	its a little bit magic but not really - its the same old applications you're used to
2018-12-20 22:33:52	@ada	corn13read: was that inside a container?  from the host?
2018-12-20 22:34:04	corn13read	ada, inside the container
2018-12-20 22:34:08	@ada	127.0.0.11 looks like the intercept-dns address for swarm containers
2018-12-20 22:34:12	@ada	so that should be correct
2018-12-20 22:34:22	corn13read	replacing it with 8.8.8.8 fixes external resolution
2018-12-20 22:34:31	@ada	that isn't how docker works but its a good test
2018-12-20 22:34:41	corn13read	I know
2018-12-20 22:34:46	@ada	the host should forward un-resolved dns requests from the container to the dns server in /etc/resolv.conf
2018-12-20 22:34:53	@ada	what is your host resolv.conf
2018-12-20 22:34:57	corn13read	digging google at 127.0.0.11 yields: connection timed out; no servers could be reached
2018-12-20 22:35:10	@ada	so it sounds like iptables then
2018-12-20 22:35:28	@ada	do you ahve anything occupying port 7946 udp or tcp?
2018-12-20 22:35:38	@ada	it could be gossip is blocked by some other app i suppose
2018-12-20 22:35:58	corn13read	this is a brand new ec2 machine installed with docker-machine with nothing running except docker
2018-12-20 22:36:12	@ada	swarm networking uses udp:4789 for vxlan transport (tcp/udp between containerized applications talking to each other) it uses tcp/udp:7946 to exchange service discovery information
2018-12-20 22:36:15	@ada	check please
2018-12-20 22:36:21	@ada	better safe than sorry
2018-12-20 22:36:37	@ada	corn13read: what kernel are you using on aws
2018-12-20 22:36:44	@ada	also check that ip_forwarding is enabled
2018-12-20 22:37:01	enderandpeter	ada: Your dockercon eu talk? God damn, sir! :-)
2018-12-20 22:37:09	@ada	but I can safely say that we run hundreds of nodes on aws without issue so there has to be something here that doesn't add up
2018-12-20 22:37:28	corn13read	4 4.4.0-1072-aws
2018-12-20 22:37:44	@ada	can you run a mainline kernel and eliminate that as a possibility
2018-12-20 22:37:55	corn13read	I'm running another cluster that initially had this issue but adding a random new network for our stack fixed it for that stack
2018-12-20 22:37:56	@ada	rather than -aws modified
2018-12-20 22:38:06	@ada	idk how to debug an anecdote
2018-12-20 22:38:15	@ada	if you can give me that entire test reproduction I might be able to look at that
2018-12-20 22:38:24	@ada	theres too many variables
2018-12-20 22:38:28	corn13read	Sure thing, simple to deploy
2018-12-20 22:38:32	corn13read	have a script
