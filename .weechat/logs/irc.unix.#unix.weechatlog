2018-12-12 01:41:12	Ergo	does anyone know a fix for 2bwm breaking games? 
2018-12-12 01:41:50	Ergo	for some reason launching games while using 2bwm causes issues where games dont launch or get really odd windows while also locking me out of my system unless i close x, this issue doesnt exist when using for example openbox 
2018-12-12 02:04:21	acg	Ergo: only issue i've had like that was with Java windows but there's a fix for that on the README.md
2018-12-12 02:04:33	acg	without trace I couldn't tell what's happening either
2018-12-12 02:06:01	Ergo	acg: i have a feeling it has to do with the way 2bwm handles fullscreen windows 
2018-12-12 02:06:21	Ergo	which does give it its lovely feature of having containers for fullscreen windows 
2018-12-12 02:11:08	Ergo	brb

2018-12-12 05:17:35	@venam	Ergo: not sure what this is about, maybe we could debug that
2018-12-12 05:18:14	@venam	though the handling of rendering while in fullscreen is done by X11 and not by the window manager
2018-12-12 05:19:03	@venam	Ergo: I don't exactly remember if there's handling for the ewmh of fullscreen
2018-12-12 05:19:09	@venam	we could add it though if it's not there
2018-12-12 05:33:47	@venam	Ergo: if I remember well, there's an optimization that X11 does when you are using a compositor in full screen

2018-12-12 09:25:53	@venam	z3bra: o/
2018-12-12 09:30:25	@z3bra	sup?
2018-12-12 09:30:53	@venam	z3bra: reading a paper for the newsletter of this week
2018-12-12 09:30:55	@venam	you?
2018-12-12 09:33:35	@z3bra	fine thanks :)
2018-12-12 09:33:45	@z3bra	just arrived at work
2018-12-12 09:33:53	@z3bra	started reading about let's encrypt
2018-12-12 09:34:04	@z3bra	to see how it's better than self-signed
2018-12-12 09:35:45	@venam	z3bra: for one it's now part of most OSs and browsers' trust stores
2018-12-12 09:35:54	@venam	and it's simple to deploy and maintain
2018-12-12 09:36:19	@z3bra	well, the part where it's "there by default" doesn't work for me
2018-12-12 09:36:58	@z3bra	I don't like the idea of centralized companies that decide wether or not your website is "secure"
2018-12-12 09:37:27	@z3bra	I'd rather go with a CA that we build ourselves @nixers for example
2018-12-12 09:37:42	@venam	z3bra: sure, but that's not the point
2018-12-12 09:37:52	@z3bra	well, it kinda is
2018-12-12 09:37:52	@venam	you're still in control of your cert and its algorithm
2018-12-12 09:38:10	@venam	which is the actual point of having a cert in the first place
2018-12-12 09:38:34	@z3bra	https://www.tedunangst.com/flak/
2018-12-12 09:38:42	@z3bra	he went with his own CA
2018-12-12 09:39:09	@venam	yeah, I know that guy, I just don't agree with the concept
2018-12-12 09:39:12	@z3bra	that I imported
2018-12-12 09:39:24	@z3bra	I kinda like it
2018-12-12 09:39:27	@z3bra	anyway
2018-12-12 09:39:44	@venam	we have our own CA at work and the private key has to be stored offline on a hardware security module, and once a week we do "ceremonies"
2018-12-12 09:39:51	@venam	to sign certs and all
2018-12-12 09:39:57	@z3bra	The fact let's encrypt is trusted by browser won't convince me
2018-12-12 09:40:05	@z3bra	that's what I mean
2018-12-12 09:40:23	@z3bra	'cause my hosting provider can give me certs too
2018-12-12 09:40:46	@z3bra	so in this regard, let's encrypt is not better
2018-12-12 09:40:51	@venam	z3bra: the point I'm making is that the CA is not that important but the algorithm of the certificate itself is way more
2018-12-12 09:41:12	@z3bra	yes
2018-12-12 09:41:34	@venam	the whole point of the PKI is to ensure we're all using good and secure crypto
2018-12-12 09:41:50	@z3bra	you can use good crypto with self-signed
2018-12-12 09:41:53	@venam	and that domains are owned by who says they own it
2018-12-12 09:42:18	@venam	^ and you can't do that part unless you have skin/money in the game
2018-12-12 09:42:31	@z3bra	and that is what bother me
2018-12-12 09:42:43	@venam	z3bra: you certainly can, and you can use even better crypto even
2018-12-12 09:42:50	@z3bra	you should trust CA you actually trust
2018-12-12 09:43:13	@venam	but you have no authority on domain names and the right to say "hey I own this and I've proven I'm up for this usage"
2018-12-12 09:43:23	@venam	'cause it's not only about domain but about usages extensions too
2018-12-12 09:43:45	@venam	there are stuffs you have to pay like $10K per domain to be able to use them for the specific usage
2018-12-12 09:44:01	@z3bra	yeah I know
2018-12-12 09:45:33	@venam	letsencrypt in all this only comes in to prove you own the domain, you can have any cert you want, though you can sign another cert with a cert signed by letsencrypt
2018-12-12 09:45:42	@venam	*can't
2018-12-12 09:46:19	@z3bra	how do you prove you own the domain?
2018-12-12 09:46:20	@venam	basically they put a file in your web root that is signed and validates it, something of that sort
2018-12-12 09:46:26	@z3bra	ok
2018-12-12 09:46:55	@z3bra	so they don't do anything special, besides doing it for free
2018-12-12 09:47:04	@z3bra	(and forcing expiry to 90 days)
2018-12-12 09:47:29	@venam	they add some particular extensions and the usual revocation stuffs
2018-12-12 09:48:20	@z3bra	so they're just like any CA
2018-12-12 09:48:23	@z3bra	but for free?
2018-12-12 09:49:40	@venam	yeah, they aren't the root CA though, they're an intermediary CA
2018-12-12 09:49:56	@venam	but the revocation list is on their node, so it's the same
2018-12-12 09:50:22	@z3bra	who's the root?
2018-12-12 09:51:02	@venam	CN = ISRG Root X1
2018-12-12 09:51:03	@venam	O = Internet Security Research Group
2018-12-12 09:51:03	@venam	C = US
2018-12-12 09:51:23	@z3bra	ah, yeah ok
2018-12-12 09:51:28	@venam	https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/
2018-12-12 09:51:39	@z3bra	I though it was another CA like comodo or symantec
2018-12-12 09:52:11	@venam	nah, symantec are too much of money grabers to do that for free stuff
2018-12-12 09:52:13	@venam	hahahahaha
2018-12-12 09:52:36	@venam	z3bra: from that page it seems like the plan of letsencrypt is to use cross sign until their own root is trusted enough
2018-12-12 09:53:43	@venam	z3bra: we do this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_ceremony at work... it's extensive 
2018-12-12 09:53:57	@venam	> The actual root key-pair generation is normally conducted in a secure vault that has no communication or contact with the outside world other than a single telephone line or intercom. Once the vault is secured, all personnel present must prove their identity using at least two legally recognized forms of identification. Every person present, every transaction and every event is logged by the lawyer in a 
2018-12-12 09:54:03	@venam	root key ceremony log book and each page is notarized by the notary. From the moment the vault door is closed until it is re-opened, everything is also video recorded. The lawyer and the organization's two signatories must sign the recording and it too is then notarized.
2018-12-12 09:54:07	@venam	Finally, as part of the above process, the root key is broken into as many as twenty-one parts and each individual part is secured in its own safe for which there is a key and a numerical lock. The keys are distributed to as many as twenty-one people and the numerical code is distributed to another twenty-one people. 
2018-12-12 09:54:26	@z3bra	yeah these ceremony are insane...
2018-12-12 09:54:38	@venam	z3bra: you do them too?
2018-12-12 09:55:43	@z3bra	hopefully not
2018-12-12 09:56:00	@z3bra	we don't have our own CA because it's too extensive of a process

2018-12-12 10:29:20	@z3bra	Dworin, these warnings are bad
2018-12-12 10:29:37	@z3bra	they should be more explicit
2018-12-12 10:29:49	@z3bra	eg, you get a warning for self-signed
2018-12-12 10:29:59	@z3bra	but you don't get one for no SSL
2018-12-12 10:30:21	@z3bra	(and that's why I still don't have SSL enabled, btw)
2018-12-12 10:51:57	@venam	z3bra: I agree, the errors are not explicit enough and human enough, it should probably write "This person has built their own security instead of relying on the standard infrastructure, do you trust them enough", or "this certificate has expired and is not trusted anymore", or "this certificate is using old crypto that is not secure", or or.. you know
2018-12-12 11:31:41	@z3bra	yup

2018-12-12 12:21:53	Ergo	any info you think might be useful? i know that the problem doesnt happen while using openbox for example 
2018-12-12 12:23:16	Ergo	i am not using a compositor if that maters 
2018-12-12 12:25:35	acg	good morning

2018-12-12 12:27:03	acg	how's it going?
2018-12-12 12:34:33	@venam	Ergo: probably it's an ewmh thing, I'll have to check when I get home
2018-12-12 12:34:51	@venam	Ergo: can you give me a hint on what's the game, or what kind of games do that so that maybe I can test it alone
2018-12-12 12:35:10	Ergo	its mostly native linux games, examples being celeste and Stardew valley 
2018-12-12 12:35:18	Ergo	Hollow knight doesnt have any problems launching 
2018-12-12 12:36:35	@venam	Ergo: this https://www.ubuntufree.com/download-stardew-valley-game/ ?
2018-12-12 12:37:01	@z3bra	venam, wait 'till you finish the game though
2018-12-12 12:37:11	@z3bra	to make 100% extra sure there's no bug :P
2018-12-12 12:37:23	@venam	z3bra: hahahaha, yeah
2018-12-12 12:39:00	@venam	if it's not too big I'll download it
2018-12-12 12:39:21	Ergo	venam: yeee thats the game, but i have it on steam
2018-12-12 12:39:28	Ergo	im not sure if that affects anything 
2018-12-12 12:39:37	@z3bra	so your issue is with steam
2018-12-12 12:39:46	@z3bra	not that game especially
2018-12-12 12:39:49	Ergo	i feel like the issue would be solved if the games could be launched in borderless window or something 
2018-12-12 12:40:06	Ergo	z3bra: well all of my games have odd behaviour on 2bwm, atleast native games 
2018-12-12 12:40:21	Ergo	while not having the same issues on for example openbox 
2018-12-12 12:40:25	@z3bra	2bwm draws pixmaps around all windows
2018-12-12 12:41:37	@z3bra	it would be helpful to run "xprop" on the affected window
2018-12-12 12:42:38	Ergo	any clue on how i would do that? 
2018-12-12 12:43:04	@z3bra	run "xprop -id <WID>"
2018-12-12 12:43:13	@z3bra	WID being the window ID of your game
2018-12-12 12:43:28	Ergo	that would be hard tho since the games basically lock me out of my wm 
2018-12-12 12:43:36	Ergo	where would i find the WID? 
2018-12-12 12:43:39	@z3bra	switch to another TTY
2018-12-12 12:43:48	@z3bra	DISPLAY=:0 xprop -id WID
2018-12-12 12:43:57	@z3bra	 (or whatever your display number is)
2018-12-12 12:44:16	Ergo	can i see the window id in htop for example? 
2018-12-12 13:04:22	@venam	Ergo: if that's the case then maybe adding Steam to the list of ignored windows might solve it
2018-12-12 13:04:53	@venam	use xprop to get the right window name
2018-12-12 13:05:03	@venam	Ergo: no, you probably cannot see it from htop
2018-12-12 13:05:25	@venam	xprop check the window properties, sort of attributes stored in X11 objects
2018-12-12 13:49:44	Ergo	venam: wouldnt it concern the windows that spawn from steam 
2018-12-12 13:49:49	Ergo	the instances of the games i guess 
2018-12-12 13:53:43	@venam	Ergo: sure
2018-12-12 13:59:55	@z3bra	yes and no
2018-12-12 14:00:11	@z3bra	sometimes steam just starts another program
2018-12-12 14:00:22	@z3bra	and doesn't reparent its windows
2018-12-12 14:00:25	@z3bra	ah wait
2018-12-12 14:00:30	@z3bra	probably actually
2018-12-12 14:00:39	@z3bra	as you have the steam overlay in all games
2018-12-12 14:01:17	@venam	so maybe try doing the xprop on steam then
2018-12-12 14:02:36	@z3bra	Ergo, what I used to do back in the days, was to launch steam in picture mode
2018-12-12 14:02:41	@z3bra	in a separate X server
2018-12-12 14:03:01	@z3bra	it worked great
2018-12-12 14:03:48	@venam	Ergo: somewhere it says to start steam with -sw https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/2431
2018-12-12 14:04:00	@venam	starts steam in window mode instead of fullscreen
2018-12-12 14:05:22	@venam	there's also  -noborder
2018-12-12 14:06:43	@venam	otherwise you can try what z3bra proposed, start it in bigpicture mode in a separate session
2018-12-12 14:06:52	@venam	we can also try debugging the issue too
2018-12-12 14:13:39	@z3bra	without steam's code it's gonna be tough
2018-12-12 14:29:23	Ergo	z3bra: i guess i could try launching it in a different session 
2018-12-12 14:29:49	Ergo	i like the ability to just have it on a workspace tho 
2018-12-12 14:29:54	Ergo	with a game and then just swap between workspaces 
2018-12-12 14:31:11	Ergo	the fixes on that page apparentlyu only apply to source engine games venam 
2018-12-12 14:35:45	@z3bra	that would be the same
2018-12-12 14:35:56	@z3bra	CM-F1 for your desktop
2018-12-12 14:36:01	@z3bra	CM-F2 for steam
2018-12-12 14:37:04	@z3bra	as easy as workspaces :)
2018-12-12 14:37:18	@z3bra	(though I do agree that it doesn't fix the issue)
2018-12-12 14:37:28	@z3bra	that's why EWMH is broken
2018-12-12 14:37:40	@z3bra	to many standards is the same as no standards
2018-12-12 14:37:56	@z3bra	no WM is 100% EWMH compliant
2018-12-12 14:38:26	@z3bra	so you can't expect the same behavior on all EWMH compliant WM
2018-12-12 14:40:02	Ergo	z3bra: hmmmmm i guess i can try that for now 
2018-12-12 14:40:17	Ergo	if only steam had a flag to just launch everything in a windowed mode that would be fantastic 
2018-12-12 14:40:39	Ergo	i could just switch to another wm but i really enjoy using 2bwm alot 
2018-12-12 14:41:59	Ergo	i also cant seem to start multiple xsessions on my gpu 
2018-12-12 14:42:03	Ergo	or im doing something wrong

2018-12-12 18:29:29	dcat	where'd fyr/wildefyr go?
2018-12-12 19:07:54	%mort	"mount: /media/m.2: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda1, missing codepage or helper program, or other error." strikes me as a very useful error message
2018-12-12 19:08:28	dcat	is that sarcasm?
2018-12-12 19:08:32	%mort	yes
2018-12-12 19:09:13	dcat	how so?
2018-12-12 19:09:21	dcat	it just tells you that it doesn't know how to mount it
2018-12-12 19:09:31	dcat	cause it doesn't recognize the filesystem
2018-12-12 19:10:03	dcat	which fs is it?
2018-12-12 19:10:13	%mort	ext4
2018-12-12 19:10:22	dcat	fsck
2018-12-12 19:10:45	%mort	turned out it was due to the nobootwait option, which people on a random reddit thread claimed existed and was useful but apparently doesn't work for ext4
2018-12-12 19:11:55	dcat	lel
2018-12-12 19:14:23	dcat	reading about it, it seems weird that it shouldn't work though
2018-12-12 19:14:36	dcat	if it doesn't work, it should just be ignored

2018-12-16 13:55:22	@venam	josuah: resting from something specific or just chilling out
2018-12-16 13:55:27	josuah	I'm playing with s6 init / service supervisor.

2018-12-16 13:56:39	@venam	how is it?
2018-12-16 13:57:43	@venam	josuah: doing fine, usual Sunday, cooking for the week and rest of the day chilling out
2018-12-16 14:00:49	 *	josuah imagine the kitchen full of fog and venam with a white apron
2018-12-16 14:01:37	@venam	close enough
2018-12-16 14:02:37	josuah	venam: it feels nice, there was the first old daemontools (http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html) and then multiple others popped out including runit and s6.
2018-12-16 14:02:47	@venam	josuah: also doing bi-weekly backup
2018-12-16 14:03:00	josuah	\o/ backups!

2018-12-16 14:03:25	@venam	josuah: just get an HDD, it's the season
2018-12-16 14:03:31	@venam	they're getting cheaper
2018-12-16 14:04:01	josuah	runit is popular for void-linux, s6 has some coverage of docker and obarun linux uses it
2018-12-16 14:04:37	@venam	josuah: does it run over the wire
2018-12-16 14:05:08	@venam	like if you have a daemon running inside a vm or docker, can you like manage them remotely too?
2018-12-16 14:05:58	josuah	venam: well there's not built-in protocol to manage them, but with ssh you can of course
2018-12-16 14:07:43	josuah	it would need a simple wrapper like « s6-tcpserver 0.0.0.0 1234 sh -c 'read service-name state && s6-svc -"$state" "/run/s6/$service-name"' »

2018-12-16 16:17:45	Ergo	flag i used was --windowed 
2018-12-16 16:17:53	Ergo	and -windowed 
2018-12-16 16:18:24	@venam	I never used steam so I'm not sure if this is how you do it
2018-12-16 16:18:44	@venam	https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1040-JWMT-2947 here it says you can right click the game and set the launch options
2018-12-16 16:19:20	Ergo	yeee , but you have to pause launch options as -option iirc 
2018-12-16 16:19:32	@venam	no idea
2018-12-16 16:19:57	@venam	Ergo: have you tried starting the game, going to a different TTY, setting DISPLAY and then doing xprop stuffs
2018-12-16 16:20:08	Ergo	i havent, cause i didnt know how lol 
2018-12-16 16:20:22	@venam	alright
2018-12-16 16:20:25	Ergo	i guess display would be 0 right 
2018-12-16 16:20:26	Ergo	or 1 
2018-12-16 16:20:35	@venam	yeah :0 or :1
2018-12-16 16:20:53	Ergo	problem i had wasthat i couldnt figure out how to get the window of the game 
2018-12-16 16:21:05	@venam	if you could only keep one window opened on that X session
2018-12-16 16:21:18	@venam	then maybe used one of those wmutils tool to list the ID of all windows
2018-12-16 16:21:28	Ergo	never used wmutils before 
2018-12-16 16:21:30	Ergo	lemme check that out 
2018-12-16 16:21:38	@venam	and then xprop -id <ID>
2018-12-16 16:22:37	@venam	Ergo: https://github.com/wmutils/core
2018-12-16 16:22:37	Ergo	kay, im in tty 2 right now 
2018-12-16 16:22:40	Ergo	game is running in tty1 
2018-12-16 16:23:07	@venam	I think it's the lsw util
2018-12-16 16:23:37	@venam	it lists currently opened windows
2018-12-16 16:24:26	Ergo	would you run that like 
2018-12-16 16:24:30	Ergo	lsw display:1 ? 
2018-12-16 16:25:09	@venam	export DISPLAY=:0
2018-12-16 16:25:13	@venam	then run the command
2018-12-16 16:25:36	Ergo	doesnt return anything 
2018-12-16 16:25:37	Ergo	hmmm
2018-12-16 16:26:03	Ergo	lemme try stardew valley 
2018-12-16 16:26:37	@venam	maybe you can echo $DISPLAY before switchin to the TTY
2018-12-16 16:28:30	Ergo	hmm its odd 
2018-12-16 16:28:38	Ergo	lsw doesnt seem to be able to find the game windows 
2018-12-16 16:29:06	@venam	Ergo: is 2bwm still running?
2018-12-16 16:29:12	Ergo	yes 
2018-12-16 16:29:25	@venam	and lsw doesn't nag about the X session not being started?
2018-12-16 16:29:40	Ergo	nope it doesnt 
2018-12-16 16:30:22	@venam	alright, maybe you can start the game while running under openbox, and do an xprop over it
2018-12-16 16:30:28	@venam	to at least get which properties it has
2018-12-16 16:30:40	Ergo	ayee , lemme try that 
2018-12-16 16:31:24	Ergo	any tip on how to kill the x server on tty1 from tty2? 
2018-12-16 16:31:28	Ergo	since its frozen on tty1 
2018-12-16 16:32:09	@venam	Ergo: you can probably do that from top/htop
2018-12-16 16:32:39	@venam	Ergo: normally I start my session over a terminal, like that if something gets stuck I can kill 2bwm, get to that terminal and debug
2018-12-16 16:34:37	Ergo	kay im in openbox right now 
2018-12-16 16:34:56	Ergo	and the game is running, can also see its id 
2018-12-16 16:36:45	@venam	Ergo: ok, so you can do xprop on the game window now
2018-12-16 16:37:01	Ergo	it wont work with the id 
2018-12-16 16:37:16	Ergo	i can put the game in windowed mode but that wouldnt really help would it? 
2018-12-16 16:37:26	@venam	yes it would also
2018-12-16 16:37:35	@venam	but why doesn't it work with the id?
2018-12-16 16:38:11	Ergo	i might have the wrong id 
2018-12-16 16:38:25	Ergo	like if i enter xprop -id id , it doesnt give any output 
2018-12-16 16:38:39	@venam	you can type xprop in  a terminal and click on the window
2018-12-16 16:39:10	Ergo	yup, i did. but that didnt work cause the game was in fullscreen 
2018-12-16 16:39:17	Ergo	this is the output of celete in windowed mode - https://paste.pound-python.org/show/SqzNoXoG2vVs1i9jnlSd/
2018-12-16 16:40:26	@venam	Ergo: ok, can you try adding to the list of ignored windows in 2bwm "Celeste"
2018-12-16 16:40:38	@venam	static const char *ignore_names[] = {"bar", "xclock"};
2018-12-16 16:41:16	Ergo	sure thing 
2018-12-16 16:41:23	Ergo	venam: this is the output of stardew valley btw - https://paste.pound-python.org/show/0LV8EqTelzIRCpE07IAo/
2018-12-16 16:42:33	@venam	You can also add to the list of ignore_names "Stardew Valley"
2018-12-16 16:42:48	@venam	I don't see anything specific other than those OB_ openbox attributes
2018-12-16 16:43:05	Ergo	hmmm yee 
2018-12-16 16:43:21	Ergo	you dont see anything in the window properties that seems to show why it messes with 2bwm? 
2018-12-16 16:43:47	@venam	not really
2018-12-16 16:44:22	@venam	maybe it's the _NET_WM_ACTION_FULLSCREEN
2018-12-16 16:46:31	@venam	Ergo: so even the window mode doesn't work, right?
2018-12-16 16:46:44	Ergo	venam: window mode does work 
2018-12-16 16:46:52	Ergo	but if i switch from windowed to fullscreen, the window freezes again 
2018-12-16 16:49:04	@venam	Ergo: have you tried running a compositor at the same time
2018-12-16 16:49:15	@venam	Ergo: the screen stays black or something?
2018-12-16 16:50:19	Ergo	nah the game launches but the game freezes
2018-12-16 16:50:29	Ergo	venam: i have not tried running a compositor actually
2018-12-16 16:50:31	Ergo	i wil ltry compton 
2018-12-16 16:52:07	Ergo	compton still gives me the same issues 
2018-12-16 16:52:30	@venam	 _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN indicates that the window should fill the entire screen and have no window decorations. Additionally the Window Manager is responsible for restoring the original geometry after a switch from fullscreen back to normal window. For example, a presentation program would use this hint. 
2018-12-16 16:52:41	@venam	I don't see how that affect rendering even if it's not respected
2018-12-16 16:53:05	@venam	Ergo: did you also try adding the WM_NAME that you got to the list of programs that are ignored
2018-12-16 16:53:36	Ergo	yeee 
2018-12-16 16:53:46	Ergo	i added "Stardew Valley" and "Celeste" both to the ignore names list 
2018-12-16 16:54:18	@venam	so even in window mode now they shouldn't have borders
2018-12-16 16:54:28	Ergo	yee they dont have borders in windowed mode 
2018-12-16 16:54:33	Ergo	but they still crash for some reason 
2018-12-16 16:54:48	@venam	maybe it's an opengl thing, or something to do with the window manager not being a reparenting window manager
2018-12-16 16:54:49	Ergo	or crash, shhow unexpected behaviour 
2018-12-16 16:55:11	@venam	are there like options within steam to play with rendering stuffs
2018-12-16 16:55:31	@venam	I remember in the past having issues with mplayer because of rendering
2018-12-16 16:55:39	Ergo	hmmm not that i can remember 
2018-12-16 16:55:41	Ergo	or know of atleast 
2018-12-16 16:55:44	@venam	so I used -vo gl in the end
2018-12-16 16:55:58	Ergo	what does that do? 
2018-12-16 16:56:08	@venam	use opengl for graphic
2018-12-16 16:56:40	Ergo	soo, you dont think you will know how to fix it in 2bwm btw? 
2018-12-16 16:56:53	@venam	so far no idea, I'm going to download the game
2018-12-16 16:57:02	Ergo	ayee sure 
2018-12-16 16:57:07	Ergo	thanks for looking into it with me 
2018-12-16 16:57:16	Ergo	if you need anything else lemme know 
2018-12-16 16:57:37	@venam	sure

2018-12-17 09:32:51	skrzyp	anyone still uses GNU Stow / xstow in 2018 as a real thing?
2018-12-17 09:33:20	skrzyp	I found it nice and handy, but somewhat overenginnered, handy dotfiles management is like byproduct of this, not the primary tool's goal
2018-12-17 09:42:02	@z3bra	it's pointless really
2018-12-17 09:46:37	@z3bra	hey venam, did you see the website of that new nixers?

2018-12-17 09:53:36	@venam	z3bra: oh not yet, checking them at the moment
2018-12-17 09:53:39	@venam	cool stuffs
2018-12-17 09:58:04	skrzyp	z3bra: why?
2018-12-17 09:58:59	skrzyp	I know there's a better way, like changing XDG_CONFIG_DIR env vars as well as aliasing most commands with "-c"/"--config" parameters pointing to custom paths, but not everything could be managed this way
2018-12-17 09:59:13	@z3bra	skrzyp, I dont' see the point of having so many symlinks
2018-12-17 10:31:52	@z3bra	if I had to do it again (managing dotfiles), I'd use a package manager
2018-12-17 10:32:07	skrzyp	pac–WHAT
2018-12-17 10:32:15	skrzyp	ah yeah, you have your own package manager
2018-12-17 10:33:31	@z3bra	yup
2018-12-17 10:33:42	@z3bra	that can install to an arbitrary $ROOT
2018-12-17 10:34:09	skrzyp	that might sound exceptionally good as I'm trying to maintain FHS *inside* the $HOME
2018-12-17 10:34:24	skrzyp	like $HOME/bin, $HOME/usr, $HOME/etc, $HOME/var, $HOME/mnt, and so on
2018-12-17 10:36:07	@z3bra	You make a tarball like so
2018-12-17 10:36:10	@z3bra	https://p.iotek.org/yc8.txt

2018-12-17 10:36:20	@z3bra	shiet
2018-12-17 10:36:44	@z3bra	then you install it over $HOME
2018-12-17 10:36:52	@z3bra	and you dotfiles are deployed
2018-12-17 10:37:10	@z3bra	when you modify it, you recreate the tarball
2018-12-17 10:38:08	@z3bra	You barely need a package manager here bt
2018-12-17 10:38:10	@z3bra	You barely need a package manager here btw
2018-12-17 10:38:29	@z3bra	it will only help with "updates"
2018-12-17 10:38:57	@z3bra	for example, if you remove .tmux.conf from the tarball, it will delete it from your $HOME

2018-12-17 20:58:47	seth	have you guys switched from a 'barebones' window manager back to something like gnome
2018-12-17 20:58:53	seth	and be blown away by how nice it looks?
2018-12-17 21:02:11	vifino	nope. i like my minimalism.
2018-12-17 21:09:21	Ergo	why would i do that 
2018-12-17 21:09:35	Ergo	for me its not bout minimalism , but it doesnt really bring me anything i want 
2018-12-17 21:20:19	seth	I have the resources for it, gnome feels so smooth compared to bspwm
2018-12-17 21:20:37	seth	clicking on the notifications actually brings up the calling window, unlike with dunst
2018-12-17 21:20:41	Ergo	its not even about resources
2018-12-17 21:20:53	Ergo	i have a R5 2600, 16 gigs of ram and a amd r9 290 
2018-12-17 21:21:15	Ergo	but i think gnome looks ugly and is bloated. if i want to use a DE i would use KDE or xfce 
2018-12-17 21:21:35	seth	how is it ugly, there's only one status bar... I have the same thing on bspwm with lemonbar
2018-12-17 21:21:54	Ergo	i mean you can make it look better sure 
2018-12-17 21:22:27	seth	gnome-shell is using a whopping 355 MB of RSS memory
2018-12-17 21:22:31	seth	discord needs more just to be open
2018-12-17 21:22:46	Ergo	i just prefer 2bwm in general 
2018-12-17 21:22:47	seth	so I don't see where you're getting 'bloated' from
2018-12-17 21:22:48	Ergo	i love that wm 
2018-12-17 21:22:59	Ergo	i mean it comes with terminal, file manager etc etc 
2018-12-17 21:23:04	Ergo	it basically comes with a load of crap that i dont need 
2018-12-17 21:23:16	seth	I use urxvt, I don't touch the built in terminal
2018-12-17 21:23:23	Ergo	sure, but its still installed 
2018-12-17 21:23:25	seth	and I believe that stuff is marked 'optional'
2018-12-17 21:25:20	seth	the only problem I've run into so far was the 'suspend' feature freezing my windows VFIO VM
2018-12-17 21:25:32	seth	which was a simple click on a toggle to disable
2018-12-17 21:38:06	@xero	seth: nope
2018-12-17 21:38:16	@xero	minimal hipster wm masterrice
2018-12-17 21:38:22	seth	lol
2018-12-17 21:39:00	seth	I like bspwm
2018-12-17 21:39:27	@xero	im post tiling. 2bwm is where it's at
2018-12-17 21:40:01	seth	I like tiling for programming, but shit that doesn't have tiling in mind just breaks
2018-12-17 21:40:07	seth	like steam for instance, windows pop up everywhere
2018-12-17 21:40:12	@xero	mhm
2018-12-17 21:40:25	@xero	but i mostly just use term + browser w/ a little dmenu glue
2018-12-17 21:41:32	@xero	but i have almost a 1000 pkgs installed still :P
2018-12-17 21:41:42	seth	I don't even know what I'm up to
2018-12-17 21:41:54	seth	lots of aur stuff to try the latest hotness
2018-12-17 21:41:59	@xero	`{pacman,yay} -Qqs`
2018-12-17 21:42:14	@xero	i have a bunch of work crap on this box
2018-12-17 21:42:30	@xero	shit i needed once then never uninstalled
2018-12-17 21:42:41	@xero	almost spring cleaning time though
