2018-12-02 23:13:57	ronin7z	blitzkraft: i got dc'd for some reason 
2018-12-02 23:14:03	ronin7z	i was hoping something a littttle cheaper lol 
2018-12-02 23:16:07	blitzkraft	Might be worth it to check /r/mechmarket
2018-12-02 23:17:03	blitzkraft	For anything cheaper, you'd have have sacrifice in some part of the build - switches, cases, brand or even customizability.
2018-12-02 23:17:50	blitzkraft	If can do basic soldering, you can probably build one at ~$100.
2018-12-02 23:20:23	blitzkraft	Oh, forgot to add - caps. Keycaps make a lot of difference in the feel and sound of typing.
2018-12-02 23:20:41	ronin7z	blitzkraft: ayee thanks, i will have a look over there 
2018-12-02 23:20:50	blitzkraft	Good thick caps sound quite pleasant.
2018-12-02 23:20:51	ronin7z	i never have done any soldering before 
2018-12-02 23:21:04	ronin7z	i was gonna opt for browns btw , dont know too much bout keycaps either 
2018-12-02 23:22:13	blitzkraft	You can start of with a cheap $15 soldering iron kit. That will be enough to complete the build. However, it'll take about 2-4hrs of time to build.
2018-12-02 23:24:03	ronin7z	hmmm, i do have the desk space 
2018-12-02 23:24:09	ronin7z	i also dont mind the time, seems like a fun project 
2018-12-02 23:25:26	blitzkraft	Yeah. And there are a lot build logs and tutorials. And much much better choices for switches and other parts.
2018-12-02 23:26:56	blitzkraft	For a cheap build, I recommend a bent steel case, 75% pcb, cherry/gateron switches, and caps from whereever.
2018-12-02 23:27:20	blitzkraft	Amazon has standard caps sets for around $15-20.
2018-12-02 23:30:02	ronin7z	hmmm
2018-12-02 23:30:06	ronin7z	how much you reckon i will spend 
2018-12-02 23:34:16	blitzkraft	Bent steel case around $35, switches around $25, caps around $20, soldering kit $15. This sums up to $95. All that's missing is the PCB.
2018-12-02 23:35:12	blitzkraft	The PCB can vary from $30-60 depending on model and demand.
2018-12-02 23:37:36	blitzkraft	I am estimating the prices assuming you'll buy from separate vendors. However, if you pick one vendor, save on shipping; price will go down to around $75.
2018-12-02 23:37:42	blitzkraft	Excluding the pcb of cours.e
2018-12-02 23:37:52	ronin7z	ohhh that doesnt sound too bad at all 
2018-12-02 23:38:12	ronin7z	lets see what stores in my country offer , if there are any lol

2018-12-02 23:41:06	blitzkraft	Yeah. Aliexpress takes about a month to arrive.
2018-12-02 23:42:34	blitzkraft	There is another option I haven't mentioned - hand wiring. Just don't use the PCB and wire everything to a controller directly. However, this will take more work and patience.

2018-12-02 23:46:55	blitzkraft	hand wiring involves a lot of soldering.
2018-12-02 23:47:12	ronin7z	ohh well, thats prolly not something im gonna do for my first keyboard

2018-12-02 23:48:49	blitzkraft	Or you have the parts sitting in the parts bin.
2018-12-02 23:49:03	blitzkraft	Which is not uncommon for a lot of people in this hobby.
2018-12-02 23:49:12	ronin7z	ohhh right 
2018-12-02 23:49:16	ronin7z	man that seems nutty 
2018-12-02 23:49:51	blitzkraft	It's not too bad. Makes for a fun weekend and uses up unused parts.
2018-12-02 23:50:58	blitzkraft	I have enough parts to make about 3 different keyboards in my bin. From various things I removed them off of.
2018-12-03 00:00:10	ronin7z	loll 
2018-12-03 00:00:21	ronin7z	i mean if you really have alot lying around i can imagine doing that
2018-12-03 00:00:33	ronin7z	on the other hadn, ive never done this stuff before so we will have to see 
2018-12-03 00:02:07	blitzkraft	You'll get there. It's a slippery slope.

2018-12-03 14:31:32	ronin7z	but i guess i can look up the parts 
2018-12-03 14:31:49	grog	got a hackerspace or school lab or library thing? lots of places have 3D printers, laser cutters and soldering stations now.
