2018-11-08 12:57:05	armin	ergo-: definitely take the anne pro if you can live with ANSI layout only
2018-11-08 12:57:52	armin	ergo-: that thing has excellent price/value from what i've heard - i only tried it for a couple of seconds trying to identify the feel and it was pretty okayish for a cheap board
2018-11-08 13:02:20	ergo-	armin: ayeee thanks, what do you mean by ansi layout btw 
2018-11-08 13:02:25	ergo-	or is that just 60%
